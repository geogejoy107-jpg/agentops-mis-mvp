# Commercial Agent Gateway Core Owner Status

Status date: 2026-07-24

## Owned Production Boundary

The following `/api/mis` routes have specific Next.js route files and direct
TypeScript/PostgreSQL owners:

- `POST /agent-gateway/register`
- `POST /agent-gateway/session/create`
- `GET /agent-gateway/sessions`
- `POST /agent-gateway/session/revoke`
- `POST /agent-gateway/heartbeat`
- `GET /agent-gateway/status`
- `GET /agent-gateway/enrollments`
- `POST /agent-gateway/enrollment/create`
- `POST /agent-gateway/enrollment/revoke`
- `POST /agent-gateway/enrollment/rotate`
- `GET /agent-gateway/tasks/pull`
- `GET /agent-gateway/tasks/:taskId`
- `POST /agent-gateway/tasks/:taskId/claim`
- `POST /agent-gateway/agent-plans`
- `GET /agent-gateway/agent-plans/:planId/verify`
- `POST /agent-gateway/runs/start`
- `GET /agent-gateway/runs`
- `GET /agent-gateway/runs/:runId`
- `GET /agent-gateway/runs/:runId/graph`
- `POST /agent-gateway/runs/:runId/heartbeat`
- `POST /agent-gateway/tool-calls`
- `POST /agent-gateway/evaluations/submit`
- `POST /agent-gateway/artifacts`
- `GET /agent-gateway/artifacts`
- `POST /agent-gateway/plan-evidence-manifests`
- `POST /agent-gateway/runtime-events`
- `POST /agent-gateway/audit`
- `POST /agent-gateway/memories/propose`
- `POST /agent-gateway/knowledge/index`
- `GET /agent-gateway/knowledge/evidence-packet`
- `GET /agent-gateway/knowledge/retrieval-evidence-packet`
- `POST /agent-gateway/approvals/request`
- `POST /agent-gateway/prepared-actions`
- `GET|POST /agent-gateway/prepared-actions/:actionId/*`

Production execution uses the shared Agent Gateway token/session authority,
PostgreSQL transactions, row and advisory locks, workspace/agent/task/run
bindings, bounded JSON bodies, immutable replay checks, and the append-only
audit/runtime ledgers. These owners do not start or proxy to Python.

Python proxy compatibility is limited to an explicit
`AGENTOPS_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=free_local` plus
`AGENTOPS_CONTROL_PLANE_MODE=proxy` selection. It is not a production fallback.

## Plan And Receipt Binding

Agent Plan hashes use the current Python canonical JSON byte contract,
including `plan_version`. Verification persists `verified_at` and
`verification_result_hash`. Non-mock run start requires the current persisted
verification and writes both `runs.agent_plan_id` and `runs.plan_hash`.

Evidence writes recheck that run binding. Plan evidence manifests bind the
current plan hash and verification-result hash and reject caller-supplied stale
hashes. Artifact content is omitted; a lowercase SHA-256 digest is stored.
Sensitive JSON keys and token-like values are redacted before ledger storage.

## Acceptance

`agent-gateway-core-postgres-contract.ts` creates a disposable PostgreSQL
schema, applies the current migration runner, and covers:

- bearer token and child session authentication
- cross-workspace and cross-agent denial
- pull and two-agent claim concurrency
- Agent Plan create, canonical verification, and hash drift
- run-to-plan binding and cross-agent heartbeat denial
- tool, evaluation, artifact, and manifest immutable replay
- stale manifest plan-hash rejection
- raw prompt, raw response, and token omission
- zero requests to a configured Python upstream observer

`agent-gateway-core-production-boundary.ts` statically verifies the specific
route ownership, bounded bodies, explicit Free Local proxy switch, and absence
of Python process/proxy calls in production owners.

The schema contract is now `agentops_commercial_postgres_v9` with ten
checksum-pinned migrations. Workspace entitlement evaluation is serialized by
a transaction-scoped workspace advisory lock. New enrollment, child-session,
and run-start writes fail closed on missing, inactive, suspended, expired,
disabled, or exhausted entitlement and commit a bounded denial audit. Existing
idempotent writes replay before quota evaluation, enrollment rotation is
quota-neutral, and revocation remains available while entitlement is suspended.

The complete Human review acceptance also covers the first-party Human Session
owners for login, logout, current session, approval list/detail/decision,
candidate Memory review, and operator loop supervision.

Frozen commit `72a1b9f` passed the full real-runtime acceptance separately with
Hermes and OpenClaw against the same source fingerprint. Both runs used the
TypeScript Worker and PostgreSQL 16, performed a real provider call with
`dry_run=false`, and started neither the Python Worker nor Python API.

## Still Open

The broader commercial product still needs direct production ownership and
acceptance for:

- approval-gated enrollment request, Human decision, and one-time
  issue-after-approval ownership
- remaining commercial policy and entitlement administration surfaces
- remaining browser dashboard, agent, connector, and deployment workflows
- BYOC packaging, upgrade, backup/restore, rollback, and promotion receipts

Commits after `72a1b9f` require a new same-SHA Hermes/OpenClaw run before any
release claim. This status therefore records route ownership and prior frozen
runtime proof, not current-head commercial release authority.
