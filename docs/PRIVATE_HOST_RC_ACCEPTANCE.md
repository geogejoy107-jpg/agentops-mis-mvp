# Private Host Release Candidate Acceptance

Status: preview.39 is published and installed with sustained Hermes/OpenClaw Fleet freshness and fresh real Runtime evidence; preview.38 remains the latest authenticated physical MacBook receipt, while ordinary browser-only Relay and current-package physical gates remain open

This matrix is the requirement-by-requirement completion record for
`LOCAL_HOST_REMOTE_CONSOLE_SPEC.md`. A deterministic smoke proves only the
bounded behavior it names. Cross-device and real-runtime rows require fresh
physical evidence and cannot be closed by mock output.

## Functional Acceptance Matrix

| # | Requirement | Current evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clean Host installs from a versioned asset without cloning | GitHub prerelease `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.39` publishes five provenance/checksum/archive/bootstrap assets from exact commit `17801e3bbb20cdaec68e72f3e225ab5492d8f8e2`. Two candidates were byte-equal; Candidate, Draft and public downloads matched; an isolated public-network consumer passed no-repository install/start/status/stop. The real preview.38-to-preview.39 upgrade preserved data and created a verified pre-update backup. A receipt from another clean physical Mac remains missing. | Passed locally; external evidence required |
| 2 | `agentops host start` serves production UI/API/ledger/knowledge and actionable worker state | Installed preview.39 serves the managed production UI/API/ledger/knowledge stack. Four Fleet samples spanning 105 seconds retained two fresh execution-capacity Workers and zero stale/unavailable services, closing the preview.38 regression. The real installer passed the 2 GiB storage floor and immutable backup gate. | Passed on installed package; reboot/log-rotation evidence open |
| 3 | Browser-only second computer opens the stable per-Host HTTPS console, pairs and authenticates | A physical MacBook authenticated through the advanced Tailscale HTTPS profile with only the dedicated browser Console and no AgentOps project or Runtime dependency. The ordinary path still requires a deployed L4 Relay, Host-side TLS, one-time pairing and a physical Console with no Tailscale/VPN client. | Passed on advanced profile; ordinary Relay evidence required |
| 4 | Unauthenticated UI/API data fails closed | `human_browser_auth_smoke.py`, `private_host_owner_browser_handoff_smoke.py`, artifact-download smoke and lifecycle acceptance cover anonymous denial, setup-code authority, role/session separation and CSRF/Origin checks. The physical MacBook received HTTP 401 for protected workspace reads and task creation before login, then again for dashboard, approved artifact and Host-receipt downloads after UI logout. | Passed locally and on physical advanced client |
| 5 | Remote task, observation, approval, evaluation/audit review and approved artifact download | The preview.38 MacBook dedicated Console remains the latest physical Owner review/download/logout receipt. Preview.39 now has fresh Host-local Runtime and ledger closure, but its current-package physical review and Human Session service-control receipt remain open. | Last physical review passed on preview.38; preview.39 retest open |
| 6 | Explicitly confirmed Hermes/OpenClaw task writes complete bounded evidence | Persistent preview.39 services independently pulled metadata-only retention tasks and completed Hermes run `run_gw_0dfd8981a340` plus OpenClaw run `run_gw_a46813718b06`. Each produced one Tool Call, passing Evaluation, Artifact, Memory, eight Runtime Events, a quality-100 Agent Plan and verified plan-evidence manifest with zero Prepared Actions. | Passed on current Host package; physical current-package review open |
| 7 | Browser or Relay disconnect does not stop Host Worker or lose/duplicate task | `PRIVATE_HOST_CONSOLE_DISCONNECT_ACCEPTANCE.md` covers Host-local Session loss. The physical MacBook dedicated browser was also closed while `run_gw_edfe2753846f` was running; the Host completed it, reconnect showed the same job/task/run, and bounded readback found exactly one workflow job and one run. Deployed-Relay interruption evidence remains missing. | Passed on Host and physical browser disconnect; deployed Relay evidence required |
| 8 | Host restart preserves ledger and knowledge state | `PRIVATE_HOST_RESTART_PERSISTENCE_ACCEPTANCE.md` covers Session, task and a 194-document local Markdown/FTS index remaining searchable after managed restart. | Passed locally |
| 9 | Backup and restore pass on isolated database | `PRIVATE_HOST_BACKUP_RESTORE_ACCEPTANCE.md` covers strict manifest/hash/schema/integrity/foreign-key checks, atomic replacement and access revocation. | Passed locally |
| 10 | Release/Git contain no credentials, DB, raw prompt/response or generated dependencies | Bundle forbidden-member scan, clean-clone tracked-file selection, release-consumer smoke and secret boundaries pass. Sample exports, DB, `.env`, `node_modules`, caches and temporary browser fixtures were excluded from commits and Release assets. Git does not track `dist`; the Release intentionally packages only the prebuilt production UI so a customer Host needs no Node runtime. | Passed locally; repeat at RC |

This preview is not the final Release Candidate until the physical-device gates
below pass. It is also not the current install candidate after the source
shadowing defect was found. Corrected preview.2 repeats the exact-head build,
checksum, Release download, and clean-install gates below.

## Superseded Preview 2

- Tag: `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.2`

- Zip archive: `380731159b45ea454d04a92933d5ebbcd608f668cc5fd3328bdab855873df714`

preview.2 passes the Release-download/install gate and adds the browser device
checklist plus Owner-only Host authority receipt. Exact-package Hermes/OpenClaw
dogfood then proved the Worker could claim tasks but could not pass Agent Plan
verification because four authority specs were absent from the archive. The
gate failed closed before model invocation. preview.2 is therefore superseded;
preview.3 provides both packaged Agent Plan verification and fresh real
Runtime execution before physical second-device acceptance proceeds.

## Superseded Preview 3

- Tag: `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.3`
- Exact commit: `642471f571d9943f9c4c217b3912e32f6728dfce`

preview.3 packages the four Agent Plan authority specs omitted from preview.2.
The installed-package smoke now starts an isolated Private Host and verifies
plan creation, plan verification, run start, evaluation, artifact and verified
plan-evidence manifest creation. A separate exact-package live pass completed
fresh Hermes and OpenClaw customer tasks and generated Owner-approved Host
authority receipts. GitHub download/checksum/install/start/route/stop passed in
an isolated directory. Physical tailnet, second-computer and another-Mac gates
remain open. preview.4 supersedes it with durable async disconnect and
idempotent launch acceptance.

## Superseded Preview 4

- SHA-256 manifest: `84bf6ca00ffc9e5a45be2cc91d47ed6bbc147f6b05e20d49eb46b4df9f8ccc1b`

preview.4 adds idempotent async customer-worker submission, SQLite
compare-and-swap launch leases, concurrent single-job/single-run proof,
durable queued-reservation recovery, and workspace-scoped job reads and
mutations. Exact-package Hermes and OpenClaw jobs completed after the first
Host-local Session clients were discarded; fresh Owner Sessions then approved
the deliveries and verified Host authority receipts. GitHub
download/checksum/install/start/route/stop also passed in an isolated directory.
Physical tailnet, second-computer, physical disconnect and another-Mac gates
remained open. preview.5 and preview.6 supersede this package.

## Superseded Preview 5

- Tag: `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.5`
- Exact commit: `d281adae3ef97229c1861b27f2e559bb7edd1fe3`
- Push CI: passed at the exact commit (`29194637789`)

- Release: `https://github.com/geogejoy107-jpg/agentops-mis-mvp/releases/tag/v1.6.0-private-host-preview.5`

preview.5 hardened Tailscale URL readiness, Serve ownership, Funnel blocking,
DNS drift and graceful restart behavior. A real upgrade then found that the
persistent production UI path remained pinned to preview.4, so preview.6
supersedes it.

## Superseded Preview 6

- Tag: `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.6`
- Exact commit: `961740e6609d61fdd1ba2f7c551e34df714fdf32`

- Release: `https://github.com/geogejoy107-jpg/agentops-mis-mvp/releases/tag/v1.6.0-private-host-preview.6`
- SHA-256 manifest: `1542921dd18bfeeb8b07aef3fcc81157cd3cefcc9c1ccbdf03de165044f60f1d`

- Zip archive: `e520ba624671f996bba9b2fe57d1f32427dd7223b4f6bc2e9c945a4fefdda770`

The Host downloaded and verified the GitHub assets, created a pre-update
ledger backup, upgraded from preview.5 with user data preserved, and started
real Hermes/OpenClaw Workers. Host status proves the managed UI now resolves to
preview.6, private HTTPS port 8443 is exclusively owned by MIS, Funnel is off,
and the existing port 443 target remains untouched. The private HTTPS Workspace
returned HTTP 200 and one physical Console peer was reachable over the tailnet.
No DNS name, IP, account, credential, setup code, Session or raw Runtime content
is retained here. Owner bootstrap, the physical browser workflow, physical
disconnect/reconnect, and another-Mac clean install remain open, so this is not
the final Release Candidate.

## Superseded Preview 7

- Zip archive: `ae3200c7d84f881a2e9b161ff78cf7f5447d8c451fea6613652dc67f5056f007`

preview.7 adds the Host-local `bootstrap-owner` command, serializes concurrent
first-Owner creation, bypasses environment proxies, rejects redirects and
password-style argv without echoing values, and separates Worker, CLI-helper
and npm/Vite environments through purpose-specific allowlists. GitHub download
and published checksums passed; upgrade from preview.6 created a verified
pre-update backup, preserved user data, and restarted real Hermes/OpenClaw
Workers. The managed UI resolves to preview.7 and private HTTPS Workspace
returned HTTP 200 with Funnel disabled. Operator Owner creation, physical
second-device workflow/disconnect receipt and another-Mac clean install remain
open, so this is not the final Release Candidate.

## Superseded Preview 8

- Tag: `v1.6.0-private-host-preview.8`
- Exact commit: `350b4d1966c74d80db8f58f0873562e018a714da`
- Push CI: passed at the exact commit (`29199084891`)

- Release: `https://github.com/geogejoy107-jpg/agentops-mis-mvp/releases/tag/v1.6.0-private-host-preview.8`
- SHA-256 manifest: `251bbf675061114bcfc4ae81c5f2cd23b3da467e468a188f771d7e668371971a`
- Tar archive: `4d13fc2613ab03824957daa935164ff65d484ddcea2b8ba352480b12431fcc10`
- Zip archive: `eb46b3d27c4d75dde66641aac48be7125b4fe1e06d6a2c51a2d9cbf5bd9a2727`

preview.8 adds confirmation-gated `host configure-cli`, binds saved machine
credentials to their configured origin, and keeps browser Sessions separate
from Agent Gateway credentials. Shared CLI and Worker credential transport now
requires literal-loopback HTTP or HTTPS, bypasses environment proxies, rejects
redirects, and redacts known or Host-format keys from errors. Credentialed Host
commands additionally require a live managed Host PID; foreground and
background Host modes both maintain that record. Published checksums, same-Mac
upgrade with user-data preservation, private HTTPS Workspace readback, and
installed Hermes/OpenClaw adapter preflight passed. Both real Workers are
running, Funnel remains disabled, and the managed UI resolves to preview.8.
Operator Owner creation, an exact-preview.8 confirmed customer run, the
physical second-device workflow/disconnect receipt, and another-Mac clean
install remain open, so this is not the final Release Candidate.

## Superseded Preview 9

preview.9 adds the fixed-tag no-repository release consumer, programmatic
archive checksum verification, HTTPS-only redirects, bounded download sizes,
single-parser safe extraction, Python/macOS preflight, and installed provenance
readback. The release path stages a Draft, downloads and installs its assets in
a clean HOME, publishes only after that gate, then repeats through public
GitHub URLs; rejected releases are removed. Host `status` and `doctor` now
surface bounded human-login readiness without account data, and interrupted
bundle/Owner smokes clean only their registered fixture process groups.

The published four assets passed checksum verification. This Host upgraded
from preview.8 with a verified pre-update backup and user data preserved, then
started explicitly confirmed Hermes/OpenClaw Workers. Installed Gateway and
both adapter preflights passed without live execution; private HTTPS Workspace
returned HTTP 200 with Funnel disabled. Owner creation, an exact-preview.9
confirmed customer task, physical browser/disconnect acceptance and another-Mac
install remain open, so this is not the final Release Candidate.

## Superseded Preview 10

preview.10 adds product/data ownership markers, strict legacy migration and
rollback, a shared no-symlink lifecycle lock, exact shim/path/PID guards, and
PID+PGID+stable process-identity binding before stop can signal a process. A
clean detached-tag build passed the full release gates. Draft-download and
public-GitHub clean-HOME installs both initialized, started, reported ready,
and stopped successfully.

The real Host upgraded from preview.9 after verified operator and automatic
pre-update backups. Ledger counts and user data were preserved; the production
UI follows preview.10, private HTTPS returns HTTP 200, Funnel is disabled, and
installed Hermes/OpenClaw preflight passes without executing a task. Two fresh
customer-style tasks reached `waiting_approval`, proving machine credentials
did not bypass the Human Approval Wall. Owner creation, approved completed
Runtime receipts, physical browser/disconnect acceptance, and another-Mac
install remain open, so this is not the final Release Candidate.

## Superseded Preview 11

preview.11 retains all preview.10 lifecycle hardening and adds bounded Owner
password guidance. `weak_password` now states the 12-character minimum through
a fixed local message while omitting password/setup-code values and refusing
to reflect arbitrary server text. The Owner bootstrap smoke, secret scan,
clean detached-tag release gates, Draft round-trip, and public clean-HOME
round-trip passed.

The real Host upgraded from preview.10 after verified operator and automatic
pre-update backups. Ledger state, the two pending approval runs, and user data
were preserved. Production UI, private HTTPS, Hermes/OpenClaw preflight, and an
installed-product weak-password check passed. Owner creation, approved
completed Runtime receipts, physical browser/disconnect acceptance, and
another-Mac install remain open, so this is not the final Release Candidate.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.12 replaces the standalone authentication card with a locked state of
the existing AgentOps MIS Workspace shell. The macOS installer and
`agentops host open-console` can hand the protected first-Owner setup authority
to the literal-loopback browser through a fragment that is immediately
scrubbed, never sent over HTTP, never printed, and never persisted. The server
still rejects no-code bootstrap. Same-document tab reuse, terminal-error
clearing, bilingual bootstrap/login, theme controls, locked navigation and CLI
headless recovery are covered by dedicated smokes and a temporary-browser
exercise.

The public Release assets were downloaded again and verified against their
manifest before the real Host upgraded from preview.11. The installer created
an automatic pre-update backup and reported user-data preservation. Installed
version/commit readback, production UI/API readiness, private HTTPS URL,
browser-first next actions and explicitly confirmed Hermes/OpenClaw Worker
restart passed. Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion,
physical second-device workflow/disconnect evidence, and another-Mac clean
install remain open, so this is still a preview rather than the final RC.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.19 keeps first-Owner setup, sign-in and account management inside the
existing React Workspace. Locked navigation, Topbar state and the account page
share the normal production shell; authenticated identity comes from the Human
Session instead of a demo account. The installed production HTML and JavaScript
were verified byte-for-byte against the packaged UI after the upgrade.

Host startup now also rejects an already-running same-adapter local Worker
before opening the backend port. The conflict response exposes only adapter and
PID metadata, never kills the existing process, and preserves the explicit
`--no-workers` external-ownership mode. Bundle, release-consumer and isolated
ownership smokes passed without executing a live Runtime task.

The published bootstrap was then executed from its public GitHub Release URL in
a fresh temporary HOME with no repository and no existing install. It fetched
the fixed tag, verified the published checksum, installed without initializing
an Owner or starting a Runtime, and read back preview.19 at the exact release
commit. This is a same-Mac clean consumer receipt; it does not replace the
required another-Mac receipt.

The real Host upgraded from preview.18 after an operator backup and the
installer's automatic pre-update backup. SQLite integrity, user-data
preservation, production UI/API readiness, private HTTPS, exact installed
version and one Hermes plus one OpenClaw Worker passed. Owner creation,
current-package approved Runtime completion, physical second-device workflow
and disconnect evidence, and another-Mac clean install remain open. This is a
prerelease, not the final RC.

The installed macOS app was also launched through `open` and opened the same
production Workspace in Chrome while preserving the existing Host, Hermes and
OpenClaw PIDs. The managed Host-only LaunchAgent plist was staged through its
dry-run and explicit install gates with exact definition, `0600` mode and no
credential material, but it remains unloaded. Logout/reboot persistence is not
claimed.

preview.20 supersedes this package with the compact locked Workspace shell and
responsive account form. The preview.19 release and installation evidence above
remains historical evidence only.

preview.20 keeps Owner setup and sign-in inside the existing React Workspace,
but removes the locked navigation wall and inactive Topbar controls. Before
authentication, the Sidebar exposes only the current account-and-access step;
the account form uses compact settings rows on desktop and label-over-input
rows on narrow screens. The package introduces no second frontend, standalone
auth card, marketing surface or third-party UI asset.

Both published archives, the checksum document and bootstrap were downloaded
from GitHub and compared byte-for-byte with the locally built release assets.
The archive policy scan found no unsafe names or forbidden payload members. The
public bootstrap then installed preview.20 at the exact release commit in a
fresh temporary HOME without a repository, without creating a Host Owner and
without starting a Runtime.

The real Host upgraded from preview.19 after a verified operator backup; the
installer also created and verified its automatic pre-update backup. It
preserved the ledger, installed the managed UI and restored one explicitly
confirmed Hermes Worker plus one explicitly confirmed OpenClaw Worker. The
installed HTML, CSS and JavaScript matched the source release build
byte-for-byte. Browser review of the installed `18878` Workspace at 1280x720
reported HTTP 200, zero console errors and the compact setup-only shell.

Opening the installed macOS application after the upgrade reused the running
Host and both Workers: the Host, server, Hermes and OpenClaw PIDs remained
unchanged. Private Tailscale HTTPS stayed ready with Funnel disabled. No Owner
was created and no live Runtime task was executed during this package upgrade.
Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.21 supersedes this package with self-validating first-Owner password
setup. The preview.20 evidence above remains historical evidence only.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.21 keeps the same React Workspace and adds compact live validation to
the first-Owner form: the password row reports the 12-character minimum, the
confirmation row reports match/mismatch, and the create action stays disabled
until setup code, username and both password gates are locally valid. Password
visibility uses accessible eye-icon controls and resets after authentication,
logout or Session expiry. Server-side setup-code, password, Session, CSRF,
Origin and role enforcement are unchanged.

Both exact-head CI runs passed. The four Draft assets were downloaded and
matched the local candidate byte-for-byte before a clean temporary HOME
installed, started, reported `bootstrap_required`, and stopped on an isolated
port. After publication, the same four public assets again matched
byte-for-byte and a second fresh HOME installed from the public bootstrap,
served the Workspace over HTTP 200 and stopped cleanly. Neither consumer had a
repository, Owner account or live Runtime execution.

The real Host then created a verified operator backup and the installer created
its own pre-update backup before moving from preview.20 to preview.21. Ledger
integrity and user data were preserved. The installed UI matched the source
release build byte-for-byte; private HTTPS remained ready with Funnel disabled.
An installed-product browser pass loaded `/workspace` at 1280 x 720, rendered
the Chinese account setup inside the existing Workspace shell, kept the create
action disabled before valid input, and reported zero browser console errors.
One explicitly confirmed Hermes Worker and one explicitly confirmed OpenClaw
Worker resumed with fresh heartbeats and zero processed tasks in this upgrade
window. No Owner was created and `live_execution_performed` remained false.

Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.22 supersedes this package with a visual consistency correction inside
the same React Workspace. The preview.21 evidence above remains historical
evidence only.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.22 keeps Owner creation inside the existing React `AppShell` and
Workspace route. It removes decorative gradients, fluorescent locked-state
accents, oversized generated-sounding copy and the fixed-width settings track;
the account form now uses the same restrained spacing, typography, primary
color, language control and light/dark theme system as the rest of the product.
No separate setup frontend or replacement authority surface was introduced.

Both exact-head CI runs passed. Draft and public Release assets matched the
local candidate byte-for-byte. Fresh temporary HOME installations from the
candidate and public bootstrap each started and stopped on isolated ports with
no repository, Owner account or live Runtime execution. The public package
served the integrated production Workspace and reported `bootstrap_required`.

The real Host created a verified operator backup and the installer created its
own pre-update backup before moving from preview.21 to preview.22. The installed
CLI, `host status` and `host doctor` passed; the Host serves the preview.22 UI at
`127.0.0.1:18878`, private Tailscale HTTPS is ready on port 8443, and Funnel is
disabled. Browser readback rendered the Chinese Owner form inside the existing
Workspace shell. One explicitly confirmed Hermes Worker and one explicitly
confirmed OpenClaw Worker are running. Opening the installed macOS application
reused the existing Host PID instead of creating a duplicate process tree. No
Owner was created and no Runtime task was dispatched during the upgrade.

Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.23 supersedes this package with Host-managed Worker process
normalization, safe lifecycle ownership and deduplicated Fleet capacity. The
preview.22 visual-consistency evidence above remains historical evidence only.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.23 keeps the existing React Workspace and account surface from
preview.22. It normalizes the Private Host child Worker state into Worker Status
and Fleet with `management_mode:host_stack`, rejects child stop/restart through
the Worker API, disables those controls in the existing UI, and deduplicates a
process from its matching Agent row. API-managed daemons remain independently
controllable under `management_mode:daemon_api`.

Both exact-head CI runs passed. Local bundle, release-consumer and macOS
launcher smokes passed. Draft and public Release assets matched the local
candidate byte-for-byte. Fresh temporary HOME installations from the Draft and
the public GitHub bootstrap each started and stopped on isolated ports with no
repository, Owner account or live Runtime execution.

The real Host created and verified an operator backup before stopping
preview.22; the public bootstrap then completed its pre-update backup and
installed preview.23 with preview.22 retained as the previous version. The Host
is ready at `127.0.0.1:18878`, private Tailscale HTTPS remains ready on port
8443, and Funnel remains disabled. Browser readback rendered the Chinese Owner
form inside the existing Workspace with zero console errors.

One explicitly confirmed Hermes Worker and one explicitly confirmed OpenClaw
Worker are running. Worker Status reports both as `host_stack`,
`control_allowed:false`, and `process_source:worker_state`; Fleet reports two
running local daemons, two Host-managed Workers, zero API-managed daemons and
`running_workers:2`. No task was dispatched during the upgrade.

Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.24 supersedes this package with fail-closed Worker process identity
verification. The preview.23 Host ownership and Fleet normalization evidence
above remains historical evidence only.

preview.24 keeps the existing React Workspace and Host-owned Worker topology.
Every new Worker state now carries a bounded SHA-256 process identity derived
from its OS start record, command record and process group. Status recomputes
that identity before accepting the PID. A stale, replaced or tampered claim is
reported as `identity_unverified`, removed from running capacity, blocked from
start/stop/restart, and retained as a warning without exposing the process
command, environment, prompt, response or credentials.

Both exact-head CI runs passed. The local candidate passed process-identity
tamper, normal Host stack, API-managed daemon, Worker UI contract, production
UI build, bundle, release-consumer, backup/restore and secret-scan gates. All
four Draft assets matched the local candidate byte-for-byte; a clean temporary
HOME installed, initialized, started, reported `bootstrap_required`, and
stopped without a repository or live Runtime execution. The published assets
again matched byte-for-byte, and a second clean HOME completed the same public
bootstrap roundtrip.

The real Host created a verified operator backup, and the public installer
created a second verified pre-update backup before upgrading from preview.23 to
preview.24. User data was preserved. The installed Host is ready at
`127.0.0.1:18878`; private HTTPS remains ready on port 8443 and Funnel remains
disabled. Read-only browser QA rendered the Chinese first-Owner form inside the
existing Workspace shell with no horizontal overflow; no credential was entered
and no Owner was created.

One explicitly confirmed Hermes Worker and one explicitly confirmed OpenClaw
Worker are running. Both report `management_mode:host_stack`,
`process_source:worker_state`, `process_identity_verified:true`, and
`control_allowed:false`. Fleet reports two running local daemons, two
Host-managed Workers, zero API-managed daemons, zero unverified process claims
and `running_workers:2`. No task was dispatched during the upgrade.

Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.25 supersedes this package only to remove the original Figma starter
identity from the browser metadata. The preview.24 Worker identity hardening
and installed evidence above remain historical evidence.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.25 changes no route, layout, authority boundary or Runtime behavior. It
keeps the existing React `AppShell`, account settings surface, bilingual copy,
theme system and Worker controls. The browser title is now `AgentOps MIS`, and
the description names the concrete local task, approval, run, evaluation,
memory and audit surfaces instead of the original generic starter text. The
existing auth Workspace smoke now fails if the starter identity returns.

Both exact-head CI runs passed. Production UI build, auth Workspace contract,
bundle, release-consumer and release-evidence gates passed. The four Draft
assets matched the local candidate byte-for-byte. Candidate and Draft-download
archives each installed and started in clean temporary HOMEs without a
repository. After publication, all four assets again matched byte-for-byte and
the public bootstrap completed a third clean-HOME install/start/stop roundtrip.
Each installed production page returned the AgentOps MIS title and concrete
description; no Owner or live Runtime task was created.

The real Host created and verified an operator backup, and the public installer
created a separate pre-update backup before upgrading from preview.24 to
preview.25. User data was preserved and preview.24 remains available as the
previous version. The Host is ready at `127.0.0.1:18878`; private HTTPS remains
ready with Funnel disabled. Installed-product browser QA rendered the Chinese
first-Owner form inside the existing Workspace shell with no horizontal
overflow and no credential input.

One explicitly confirmed Hermes Worker and one explicitly confirmed OpenClaw
Worker are running. Both remain `host_stack`, process-verified, sleeping and
blocked from child-level control; Fleet reports two running local daemons, two
Host-managed Workers, zero API-managed daemons and zero unverified process
claims. No task was dispatched during this upgrade.

Owner creation, current-package approved Runtime completion, physical
second-device workflow and disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.26 supersedes this package by keeping first-Owner setup and sign-in
inside the complete existing Workspace navigation instead of a setup-only
shell.

- Zip archive: `13929505ae37717f37d96dccc2411fecd714a8bdda5be5fc07a2be6bff46e850`

preview.26 retained the existing React AppShell, complete front-office/admin
Sidebar, account settings surface, theme and locale controls for first-Owner
setup. Its clean-HOME install exposed a packaging defect: the installed bundle
did not provide the consumer-facing `agentops-worker` shim. preview.27 is the
corrective package and preview.26 must not be used to install Worker services.

preview.27 fixes installer, upgrade and uninstall ownership for both `agentops`
and `agentops-worker`, and its clean consumer gate executes both installed
commands. The real Host was upgraded with its Host-only LaunchAgent and two
independently service-managed adapter Workers preserved. Its old Worker Console
still reported zero Host-observed processes because service heartbeat presence
was not yet projected as execution capacity; preview.28 fixes that read model
without inventing process verification.

- Release-consumer bootstrap: `6f78549bdb4c1da6ff3128907d8b82067a3ae06741cf823b34e1acdaaf03a44f`

preview.28 keeps the complete existing React Workspace and adds a bounded
service-presence projection to the existing Worker Console. An external-service
Worker contributes execution capacity only when both its short-lived Agent
Gateway Session is active and its `agent.heartbeat` is fresh. It remains
`management_mode:external_service` and `process_state_verified:false`; the
browser/server does not execute shell or infer launchd ownership.

Exact-head CI, production UI, clean-clone RC, bundle lifecycle, clean-HOME
consumer install, both installed CLI shims, public-asset hash equality, secret
scan and strict release evidence passed. The real Host created an operator
backup and the installer created a separate pre-update backup before upgrading
from preview.27. User data was preserved, private HTTPS remained ready and
Funnel remained disabled.

The installed Host now reports two fresh service Workers and two execution
capacity lanes while correctly keeping Host-observed `running_workers=0`.
Launching the installed `AgentOps MIS.app` again kept the Host PID and both
independent service Worker PIDs unchanged, opened the existing Workspace with
the setup fragment scrubbed, omitted the manual setup-code input and performed
no Runtime task. A subsequent preview-first then explicitly confirmed Host
LaunchAgent restart replaced only the Host process, returned the same exact
preview.28 release commit, restored loopback/private-HTTPS readiness and left
the independent Hermes/OpenClaw services running; the receipt reported no
Worker action or live Runtime execution. Owner creation, current-package
approved Runtime completion,
physical second-device workflow/disconnect evidence, another-Mac clean install
and logout/reboot service proof remain open. This is a prerelease, not the final
RC.

The installed preview.28 CLI also created and verified a fresh online backup
while the Host remained ready. Manifest, hash, size, schema, SQLite integrity
and foreign-key checks passed; the secret store was excluded and no raw ledger
rows or token values were printed. The user's live ledger was not restored;
confirmed restore and access-revocation behavior remain proven against isolated
state.

preview.29 was published as a GitHub prerelease through the manual prerelease path.
The Private Host Preview Release workflow did not run. Candidate and
public clean-HOME install/start/status/stop passed, and every public asset was
byte-equal to its candidate counterpart.

The real Host upgraded from preview.28 by explicitly unloading its Host
LaunchAgent, installing preview.29, and loading the Host service again. Upgrade
readback reported `previous_version=.28`. The Host and independent
Hermes/OpenClaw Worker PIDs were preserved where expected, and opening the
installed app reused the existing Host and Worker processes. No model task was
executed in this acceptance cycle.

The existing first Owner passed local login, logout and Workspace readback.
Password recovery reported available and local-only; a remote Origin and a
request without app authority both failed closed. The installed HTML, CSS and
JavaScript were byte-equal to the exact preview.29 build.

The installed online-backup receipt hash is
`c8bb0335d0602bec5c3588cd9a7ee013fc71d697ee440c645310508cfc2a3031`.
Manifest, file hash, size, schema, SQLite integrity and foreign-key checks all
passed. The secret store was excluded and raw ledger rows were omitted.

Physical second-computer acceptance, another-Mac installation, real network
disconnect, physical logout/reboot, and an exact-package approved Runtime task
remain open. No external evidence is synthesized or inferred from same-Mac,
loopback, CI, or prior-preview receipts. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.30 fixed long-running Worker idle-backoff overflow. Its real in-place
installation then exposed that both CLI shims were rewritten on their existing
inodes while LaunchAgents used those executable paths. Direct shim execution
ended with exit 137 and both Workers recorded `-9`; the versioned payload,
Host data and pre-update backup remained valid. The Host was recovered through
the installed module entry point and byte-identical shims on new inodes.
preview.30 is immutable and must not be used for another in-place upgrade.

preview.31 was published through the manual Draft-to-prerelease path because
the Private Host Preview Release workflow was not available on the default
branch. Candidate, Draft and public assets were byte-equal. Public clean-HOME
download/install, both CLI entry points, Host init/start/status/stop and a
preview.30-to-preview.31 isolated upgrade passed.

The real Host upgrade created and later verified a pre-update backup, preserved
user data, atomically replaced both CLI shim inodes and reported
`previous_version=1.6.0-private-host-preview.30`. The independent Worker
processes survived installation without exit 137 or `-9`; explicit restarts
then ran Hermes and OpenClaw from the preview.31 `current` directory. Host
health, Owner login readiness and private HTTPS returned ready, with Funnel
still disabled.

Opening the installed preview.31 macOS app preserved Host PID `37995`, Hermes
Worker PID `38056`, OpenClaw Worker PID `38080` and the bounded Run count of 36.
It opened the existing console without creating a Runtime task or duplicate
process. No browser visual readback is claimed for that receipt.

Installed service Workers completed tasks
`tsk_preview31_openclaw_readonly_20260715T055005Z` and
`tsk_preview31_hermes_readonly_20260715T055005Z`. Their runs
`run_gw_612fb884979c` and `run_gw_9767258929f0` completed without an error type,
each producing one tool call, passing evaluation, artifact, reviewable memory
candidate and a verified plan-evidence manifest. Two earlier tasks containing
negated external-action wording never invoked a Runtime. A fresh private-HTTPS
Owner Session rejected both prepared actions and both low-value generic memory
candidates. The approvals, memories and four bounded audit rows all read back
as rejected; the Session logged out without exposing credential or raw content.

Physical second-device login/disconnect, another-Mac clean install and
logout/reboot service proof remain open. The same-Host private-HTTPS Owner
receipt does not substitute for those physical gates, and no external evidence
is synthesized. This is a prerelease, not the final RC.

preview.39 packages the scoped Host-machine Session heartbeat observation,
workspace-bound Fleet projection, immutable backup verification and safe
backup-sidecar retention corrections developed after preview.38. Two candidate
directories were byte-identical. Candidate, Draft and public downloads matched,
and a public-network consumer completed no-repository install/start/status/stop
with exact provenance readback.

The real Host and both independent Worker LaunchAgents were explicitly
unloaded. The public installer passed the real storage preflight without a test
override, created a verified pre-update backup, preserved the authority ledger
and Owner state, set `current=preview.39` and `previous=preview.38`, and exposed
the additive heartbeat-observation table. The Host-only LaunchAgent returned
health `ready`; Human login stayed ready, Tailscale Serve remained exclusive on
private HTTPS port 8443 and Funnel remained disabled.

Four bounded Fleet samples spanning 105 seconds remained `ready` with two
execution-capacity Workers, zero stale services and zero unavailable services.
Both selected Sessions remained `fresh_ready` with execution scope present.
Fleet liveness binds the exact selected full-scope execution Session, while
missing or mismatched observations fail closed. This is installed-package
evidence for the post-90-second defect; it is not inferred from global Agent
status or old Runtime Events.

The persistent services then independently pulled two normal MIS tasks. Hermes
completed `run_gw_0dfd8981a340`; OpenClaw completed
`run_gw_a46813718b06`. Each produced one Tool Call, one passing Evaluation, one
Artifact, one Memory candidate, eight Runtime Events, a quality-100 Agent Plan
and a verified plan-evidence manifest. Both had zero Approval and zero Prepared
Action rows because the metadata-only retention review prohibited session-body
access, deletion and external writes. No one-shot Worker command substituted
for service execution.

The exact package also passed the Host free-space preflight and backup
retention/prune command gates. The earlier live prune retained five complete
verified groups and reclaimed approximately 2.63 GB without deleting the live
database, any retained backup, credential, log or release. Generated release
homes and ignored UI dependencies were removed after acceptance; Codex,
OpenClaw and Docker state was not deleted.

Open gates remain explicit: deployed Relay/DNS/TLS, no-Tailscale browser
pairing, deployed-Relay interruption, current-package physical browser
disconnect/reconnect, current-package physical browser review, authenticated
Human Session service-control receipt, Host logout/reboot recovery,
another-Mac clean installation, and bounded Host log rotation. The current
preview therefore remains a prerelease.

preview.38 packages the Intake-blocked Worker heartbeat emission and
workspace-scoped sampling corrections discovered on preview.37. Both
exact-head CI runs and the strict release gates passed. Two clean candidates
were byte-equal. All five Candidate, Draft and public assets matched
byte-for-byte, and isolated Candidate, Draft and public-network consumers each
completed no-repository install/start/status/stop with exact version and commit
readback. GitHub could not dispatch the branch-only release workflow because it
is absent from the default branch, so the already documented manual
Draft-to-public path performed the same two consumer gates.

Before real maintenance, only stopped AgentOps test directories under
`/private/tmp` were removed; no historical backup or authority ledger was
deleted. A fresh preview.37 backup passed hash, schema, integrity and
foreign-key verification. Both Worker LaunchAgents and the Host LaunchAgent
were explicitly unloaded. The public installer created its own verified
pre-update backup, preserved Host data, recorded preview.37 as the previous
version and bound `current` to preview.38 at the exact release commit.

The preview.38 Host returned health `ready`, Human login remained available,
Tailscale Serve stayed configured and Funnel remained disabled. Both service
Workers returned with new processes. Against the same Intake-blocked queue that
left preview.37 stale, Fleet now reported `ready`, two execution-capacity
Workers and zero stale service Workers without invoking either model.

That first readback did not cross the full freshness window. A later sample
beyond 90 seconds reported zero execution capacity and two stale service
Workers while both launchd processes and loop iterations remained current.
Host-machine Sessions have no parent enrollment token; their same-state
heartbeats refreshed the workspace-scoped observation every 60 seconds but did
not amplify the 15-minute Runtime/Audit ledger sample. Preview.38 Fleet read the
historical event rather than the current observation. The source follow-up now
binds the current workspace observation to the exact selected full-scope
execution Session. Human and Host Fleet reads are workspace-scoped;
heartbeat-only Sessions cannot lend liveness; missing or mismatched
observations fail closed; and no enrollment or unscoped Runtime Event fallback
controls service freshness. Global Agent status is not capacity evidence, a
new unobserved Session cannot shadow a healthy observed Session, and
`paused`/`error`/`disabled` heartbeats contribute zero capacity. A healthy
Session is selected ahead of a newer non-ready replica; mixed replicas retain
one deduplicated capacity while Fleet reports degraded Session evidence and
`attention`. Human Fleet
hygiene, task release, Local/Demo Readiness, Commander read models, Review
Queue, Customer Delivery Board and Operator Action Plan/Command Center/Health
are bound to the authenticated Human Session workspace. Dual-workspace HTTP
coverage proves that task/run/approval/memory/artifact references from another
workspace are not returned. The same contract covers core Agent/task/run/tool/
Evaluation/artifact lists and details, run graphs/exports, Dashboard metrics,
knowledge results, and bounded Operator handoff/start-check/loop aggregates;
cross-workspace details and mutations fail closed. Task IDs cannot be rebound
across workspaces, and conflicting Agent Gateway Artifact/Approval IDs return
`409` without replacing the original ledger row. This does not yet claim hosted
multi-tenancy: the Agent registry is Host-global with explicit membership for
Human-created Agents plus authoritative owner/collaborator/run/Gateway
projections. Audit workspace visibility uses exact `(entity_type, entity_id)`
pairs and remains an undercount-safe bridge until immutable first-class Audit
workspace ownership is added. Isolated Host-machine Session, mixed-offset UTC and
dual-workspace regressions pass, but a later package and sustained real readback
are required. Preview.38 is not credited with sustained Fleet freshness.

The same unreleased source slice now gives legacy Host Agents an idempotent
`local-demo` membership backfill only when no non-local Task, Run, Agent Plan or
Gateway authority evidence exists. Human Agent creation writes the Agent,
membership and Audit in one transaction, and Dashboard performance includes
visible zero-run membership, collaborator and Plan-only Agents in their
authoritative workspace. Agent Plan approvals bind
an explicit subject type, Plan ID and Plan hash in addition to immutable
task/run/tool/Agent authority; an ordinary same-authority Approval cannot be
reused as a Plan decision. Run/task mismatch, cross-workspace or reused
Approval IDs return `409`, and Tool Call plus Prepared Action creation now
rolls back as one unit. Private Host Human Sessions can decide a visible Plan
without machine credentials while the real Human Account remains in the Plan
and Audit trail. Fault-injection tests prove no partial Plan, Approval, Tool
Call, Prepared Action, membership, Run/Task state, Runtime Event or Audit
survives. These are deterministic source-level receipts only and are not
attributed to installed preview.38.

The same unreleased source slice now includes a bounded Host storage preflight.
`agentops host storage-preflight` is initialization-independent and reports only
the checked filesystem path, free/required bytes, status and omission metadata;
it reads no ledger content, credential or network. The packaged macOS installer
copied by `build_private_host_bundle.py` applies the same 2 GiB production floor
before either a new version stage or a pre-update backup, adds conservative
version and SQLite database-plus-WAL backup reserves, and checks separate
install/data/backup/bin/App volumes independently. The check precedes lifecycle
lock creation, and `current` is the final commit after CLI/App writes.
`AGENTOPS_HOST_MIN_FREE_BYTES` may raise but cannot lower the floor. A
TEST_MODE-only per-path/device capacity fixture makes both positive and negative
installer tests independent of host free space; production use of that fixture
fails before any write, while the legacy scalar override may only reduce actual
capacity. The deterministic smoke proves low space leaves the lifecycle lock,
current version, target version and backup directory untouched. This is
source-only evidence: preview.38 is not credited, and an exact-package
install/upgrade receipt on adequate storage remains open.

The same unreleased source now adds bounded Host backup retention.
`agentops host backup-prune` defaults to a verified dry-run with keep=5 and a
hard minimum of two complete SQLite/manifest pairs. A write requires both
`--confirm-prune` and the exact hash of the current full-inventory plan; a new
backup invalidates the old hash. Confirmed deletion is lifecycle-locked and
uses a same-volume private quarantine with rollback before cleanup. The
isolated 24-check smoke proves fresh-Host zero-write planning, deterministic
planning, exact confirmation, lock serialization, protected
DB/secret/log/version preservation, and fail-closed behavior for unknown,
missing, symlinked or tampered inventory. It also proves that verified
zero-WAL sidecars move with their backup pair, while orphan sidecars and
non-empty WAL files fail closed. Backup verification now uses an immutable
read-only SQLite connection so inspection cannot create new WAL/SHM files.
This remains source-level package evidence until the exact package passes the
same gate; the 2026-07-22 installed-Host retention receipt is recorded
separately below.

The next source-only slice adds bounded stopped-Host log rotation.
`agentops host log-rotate` defaults to a metadata-only plan with an 8 MiB
threshold and five retained generations. The threshold has a 1 MiB production
floor and retention is bounded from two through twenty files. A write requires
both `--confirm-rotate` and the exact inventory/configuration plan hash while holding the
Host lifecycle lock and the same private runtime lock held for the complete
local-stack process lifetime; a running Host remains detectable even without a
PID record because every long-lived backend, UI, Relay and Worker child inherits
the same runtime-lock descriptor. A stale plan, unsafe directory or file mode, symlink, hardlink,
unknown `host.log.*` name, or generation gap fails closed. All mutation uses
anchored directory descriptors. A complete owner-only staging directory is
prepared with hard links, fsynced and committed through one kernel atomic
directory exchange. Stage members are identity-checked immediately before
unlink. Initial journal publication uses native no-clobber rename and journal updates atomically
exchange two already-open, identity-bound files; a bounded private journal distinguishes and recovers
pre-exchange interruption from post-exchange committed cleanup. It reports
incomplete cleanup rather than claiming success, and Host startup fails closed
until pending recovery is explicitly completed. It neither reads log content
nor changes the ledger, secret store, config or installed version. The
Rotation itself does not rewrite `launchd.log`: its inode, owner, mode, existing
bytes and any launchd retry append are preserved, while size/mtime drift on that
same inode is permitted during recovery only when size is monotonic, while temporary hard links may update
filesystem ctime. Post-exchange recovery accepts only an identity-matching
subset of the journaled retired directory, so interruption during cleanup is
idempotently completed. A failed pre-exchange cleanup retains its journal for
the same explicit recovery path. The owner-private `0700` Host namespace plus
the lifecycle/runtime locks exclude cooperating writers; hostile same-UID
namespace mutation is outside this local isolation boundary because portable
POSIX has no inode-conditional unlink/rmdir primitive. The isolated 51-check
rotation smoke and 40-check process-tree-lifetime runtime-lock smoke passed
locally on macOS (including the `renameatx_np` path); CI runs them on the Python
3.10/3.11 Linux compatibility matrix. They use only temporary files; no
real Host log is read or rotated. Preview.38 is not credited, and the current
`bounded Host log rotation` release gate remains open until an exact package
and installed-product receipt pass. Live automatic rotation also remains open
until the Host stack has one sole-writer log sink instead of inherited child
file descriptors.

Separately, after all package and real-runtime acceptance steps, the Host volume later fell
to roughly 115 MiB free. The backend PID and loopback listener remained, but
health responses became unusable and both launchd Workers exited nonzero. A
fixed-clock regression then proved that the 60-second Worker cadence, real idle
backoff and 90-second Fleet freshness window contain no periodic stale gap.
Only one unreferenced stopped AgentOps test directory under `/private/tmp` was
removed; no database, historical backup, credential, Runtime evidence or
Tailscale configuration was touched. APFS reclaimed more than one GiB, Host
health returned HTTP 200 and the first Fleet readback returned to two
execution-capacity service Workers. Extended observation reproduced the
independent projection defect while health stayed HTTP 200. This is a recovery
receipt, not a storage-pressure or sustained-heartbeat acceptance claim.

On 2026-07-22 the corrected source retention command was dogfooded against the
real local Host backup inventory without reading backup rows. The dry-run
verified 62 complete backup groups, retained the newest five, bound 57
candidates and 2,625,702,995 reclaimable bytes to plan hash
`489521b87e7c84a559f01f154a3f1aab09509fe9218a8d86f9c45061fa327093`.
Exact confirmation removed 57 groups and 228 bound files through the private
quarantine path. A second dry-run reported inventory=5, candidates=0 and zero
reclaimable bytes; the retained directory was 473 MiB. Data-volume free space
rose from 723 MiB to 3.2 GiB and `agentops host status` remained ready. The
authority ledger, secret store, installed version, Runtime evidence and backup
contents were not read or changed. This closes the source-command real-Host
dogfood receipt only; the exact-package retention gate below remains open.

An Owner-authenticated, explicitly confirmed customer workflow then completed
real Hermes run `run_gw_c835b4dab9a9` and real OpenClaw run
`run_gw_be0e8275670f`. Each run has one tool call, one passing Evaluation, 15
Runtime Events, 12 bounded Audit rows, two Artifacts, two Memory candidates,
one delivery Approval and one passing plan-evidence manifest. No delivery
decision is inferred from Runtime completion, and no raw prompt/response,
credential, private origin, Worker log, private message, transcript or database
content was retained.

A physical MacBook reached the upgraded private HTTPS Workspace and used a
temporary dedicated Chrome profile with `--no-proxy-server` through a
loopback-only SSH/CDP tunnel. It authenticated as Owner without exposing the
credential, rendered both current Run pages with Evaluation, Runtime, Approval
and Audit entry points, and approved exactly the two new low-risk deliveries by
Task ID. One approved Artifact downloaded to a temporary directory with size
811 bytes and SHA-256
`3dbe03f31d9c42ffb15f53f18b9b85e010d0d85d7370b89174a788f903e9f6b9`;
its body was not read. UI logout then made the same browser's protected
Dashboard request return HTTP 401. The dedicated profile, download and tunnel
were removed without touching normal Chrome.

Deployed Relay/DNS/TLS, no-Tailscale browser pairing, deployed-Relay
interruption, current-package physical browser disconnect/reconnect, Host
logout/reboot recovery, another-Mac clean installation, an exact-package backup
retention/prune command, exact-package Host free-space preflight, and bounded
Host log rotation remain open. The Host-machine Session heartbeat observation
package is also open.

The current preview therefore remains a prerelease.

preview.37 packages the bounded launchd state-convergence correction discovered
during the preview.36 maintenance window. Both exact-head CI runs passed.
Two clean candidates were byte-equal. All five Candidate, Draft and public
assets matched byte-for-byte in separate download directories, and isolated
Candidate, Draft and public-network consumers completed no-repository
install/start/status/stop with exact version and commit readback.

Before the real upgrade, a fresh preview.36 ledger backup passed hash, schema,
integrity and foreign-key verification. Both Worker LaunchAgents were unloaded.
The old preview.36 Host CLI again returned a false negative after `bootout`, but
independent launchd, process and port checks proved the Host was unloaded. The
first installer attempt then failed closed before changing `current` because
its automatic backup could not complete on the nearly full data volume. After
removing only that failed partial file, a byte-identical debug backup duplicate
and stopped `/tmp` consumer homes from this maintenance window, the retry kept
the same backup gate, created a new verified pre-update backup, preserved Host
data and recorded preview.36 as the previous version.

Installed provenance and the `current` link now bind to preview.37 and exact
commit `6a87e048b7a8e40f5d33c50983c7d0c482804ffc`. The new CLI loaded the Host in
one bounded read, unloaded it successfully after two reads observed
`loaded:false`, and loaded it again in one read. Independent checks agreed with
the CLI. The Host returned health `ready`, Tailscale Serve remained configured
and Funnel stayed disabled. The Host service remained Host-only and did not
implicitly control either Worker.

Both Hermes and OpenClaw Worker LaunchAgents returned with new processes and
wrote fresh authenticated `task.pull` Runtime Events. Their assigned queue item
was Intake-blocked, which exposed a separate early-return heartbeat defect:
Fleet remained stale although the processes and task pulls were current. The
bounded correction is verified in
`PRIVATE_HOST_WORKER_INTAKE_HEARTBEAT_ACCEPTANCE.md` but remains source-only
until a later exact-commit package is installed. It is not attributed to
preview.37.

The current preview therefore remains a prerelease. Preview.36 remains the
latest package physically exercised from the advanced MacBook Console and the
latest package with fresh real OpenClaw task evidence. Deployed Relay/DNS/TLS,
no-Tailscale browser pairing, deployed-Relay interruption, the Worker Intake
heartbeat correction package, current-package real Runtime readback, Host
logout/reboot recovery and another-Mac clean installation remain open.

preview.36 packages the blank-owner Host Acceptance marker fix and the shared,
negation-aware external-write classifier found by the preview.35 physical
workflow. Both exact-head backend jobs and both production UI jobs passed. Two
independent local builds produced byte-equal five-asset sets; candidate, Draft
download and public Release assets were byte-equal. Candidate, Draft and public
network consumers each completed an isolated no-repository
install/start/status/stop flow with exact version and commit readback.

Before the real upgrade, the preview.35 Host ledger received a new verified
backup. Hermes and OpenClaw Worker LaunchAgents were explicitly unloaded, then
the Host LaunchAgent was unloaded without touching Tailscale. The public
preview.36 bootstrap preserved Host data, created its own verified pre-update
backup, recorded preview.35 as the previous version, and moved the installed
`current` link to the exact preview.36 package. The new CLI passed service
preflight and loaded the Host to `ready`; the private transport remained ready,
Funnel remained disabled, and both launchd-managed Worker processes returned.
Authenticated bounded readback reports two execution-capacity lanes and a
ready Worker fleet without reading Worker logs or model content.

On the installed package, a fresh Host-local Owner-authenticated OpenClaw customer job
`wfjob_83cb57da8242e855501f3780` completed run `run_gw_ed42f579d487`. The
request deliberately prohibited publication, external connectors, messages,
external APIs and file writes. It produced one tool call, one passing
evaluation, 15 runtime events, 12 bounded audit rows, artifact/memory evidence
and verified plan manifest `pem_e1b9275c986daf4b`, while approval readback found
zero external-write PreparedActions. Its normal delivery approval
`ap_customer_worker_delivery_run_gw_ed42f579d487` remains pending. This proves
the packaged classifier through a real Runtime on the Mini.

The physical MacBook dedicated Console then authenticated to that same installed
preview.36 Host. From **Host Acceptance**, it created marker task
`tsk_570cb03937f6`. Same-origin readback found exactly one related runtime event
and two audit rows, with zero runs, tool calls or evaluations. From the normal
AI Employees dispatch UI, the Console explicitly confirmed and submitted
OpenClaw job `wfjob_9940b1e6ea15`, which completed task
`tsk_customer_worker_task_7606dfeb537fe9f9` and run
`run_gw_c8d2ad1aa845`. Bounded readback found one tool call, one passing
evaluation, 16 runtime events, 11 audit rows, two artifacts, two memory
candidates, one delivery approval and verified plan manifest
`pem_094a19932cdcc50e`. The same negated read-only wording class created zero
external-write PreparedActions. Delivery approval
`ap_customer_worker_delivery_run_gw_c8d2ad1aa845` remains pending and was not
silently accepted. The Run page rendered the matching run plus Evaluation/Audit
entry points; UI logout then made the protected Dashboard request return 401.
No raw prompt/response, credential, private origin, browser storage, Worker log
or database content was retained.

The old preview.35 CLI exposed a bounded launchd convergence defect during the
maintenance window: `bootout` returned zero and direct process/launchd readback
confirmed the Host was unloaded, but its immediate single post-check still saw
the stale loaded state and returned `ok:false`. The upgrade continued only
after independent unloaded-state confirmation. Follow-up source commit
`a88b5fa` adds four bounded 100ms convergence reads and keeps a
never-converging launchd state fail closed. At the time preview.36 was current,
that fix was source-only and was not attributed to the installed package.
Preview.37 later packaged and accepted the correction through a real
`load -> unload -> load` roundtrip.

Preview.36 remains immutable superseded history. Its marker, negated-intent,
physical MacBook and real Runtime receipts remain valid for that exact package;
the later launchd result is recorded only under preview.37. Its separate
pending delivery decisions also remain explicit.

preview.35 supersedes previews 32 through 34. Candidate and Draft builds were
reproducible, candidate, Draft and public assets were byte-equal, and the public
release passed an isolated no-repository install/start/status/stop receipt.
The exact release source has green push and pull-request backend and UI checks.

The real Host upgrade created verified backups, preserved user data and safely
migrated the exact previous Host LaunchAgent definition before reloading the
current exact service. The private Tailscale route recovered with Funnel
disabled, and the independent Hermes and OpenClaw services returned with fresh
heartbeats. A fresh OpenClaw task completed through the persistent Worker with
bounded tool, evaluation, runtime-event, audit, artifact, memory and verified
plan-evidence records. A fresh Hermes Runtime also completed, but its delivery
remains at the Human Approval Wall; no approved delivery is claimed.

A physical MacBook reached and rendered the login Workspace before and after
the upgrade. Before login, protected workspace reads and a task-create mutation
returned HTTP 401 with no task-count change. An authenticated Owner Session then
submitted job `wfjob_ec747fe27ab2`; OpenClaw run `run_gw_edfe2753846f`
continued to completion after the dedicated Console browser closed. Reconnect
showed one matching workflow job and one run, its passing Evaluation and Audit
evidence, verified plan manifest and reviewable artifact. The Owner approved
only its low-risk delivery, rejected two low-value memory candidates, downloaded
the approved artifact and Host authority receipt
`phr_c2ea51dd3d37a09055e20889`, then logged out. Dashboard, artifact and receipt
downloads all returned HTTP 401 after logout. The bounded receipt hashes and
full physical record are in `PRIVATE_HOST_SECOND_DEVICE_ACCEPTANCE.md`; no raw
artifact or model content was copied into the repository.

The same physical flow found one release defect: the Host Acceptance marker
sent an intentionally blank owner field that preview.35 stored as an invalid
foreign key. Source commit `70bae606c577191041778a92e3480138f3b67795`
normalizes blank ownership to SQL `NULL`, preserves a zero budget and passes an
authenticated marker smoke without invoking a Runtime. A separate task with
negated external-action wording also exposed a conservative intent-classifier
false positive; its prepared action was not approved and no external action
ran. Current source now uses one negation-aware, fail-closed classifier for the
server and Worker paths, but preview.35 has not been upgraded or physically
retested with that fix.

The current preview therefore remains a prerelease. The exact marker fix must
be packaged and physically retested. Deployed Relay/DNS/TLS, no-Tailscale
browser pairing, deployed-Relay interruption, the separate Hermes delivery
decision, Host logout/reboot recovery and another-Mac clean installation remain
open.

## Release Gates

The RC may be declared only after all of the following are attached to one
exact commit and version tag:

- push and pull-request CI are green at the exact tag commit;
- `.zip`, `.tar.gz` and `.sha256.json` are attached to a GitHub prerelease;
- another Mac downloads, verifies and installs that exact asset without a
  repository, Node or Git;
- the Host exposes a stable per-Host HTTPS origin through an authenticated
  outbound L4 Relay with Host-side TLS and no direct inbound listener;
- the second computer uses only a stock browser: no Tailscale/VPN client,
  AgentOps package, repository or developer/runtime dependency;
- pairing expiry, single use, attempt limiting, role cap, replay denial, device
  revocation and bound-Session invalidation pass;
- the second computer completes login, task dispatch, observation, approval,
  evaluation/audit review and approved artifact download;
- closing the browser or interrupting the Relay does not stop a fresh confirmed
  Hermes/OpenClaw task, and reconnect shows the same task/run evidence without
  duplication;
- Relay inspection proves no application plaintext or authority state was
  durably stored;
- the advanced Tailscale profile remains fail-closed with Funnel disabled, but
  its receipt is not substituted for browser-only acceptance;
- backup/restore, restart/knowledge persistence, upgrade/rollback, secret scan,
  bundle scan and production UI build pass at the same commit.

## Evidence Rules

- Record bounded IDs, counts, statuses, exact commit, tag and checksums only.
- Do not record passwords, setup codes, Session/Agent tokens, raw prompts,
  raw responses, private messages, full transcripts, database files or Host
  paths from another user account.
- Label mock/loopback smokes as deterministic fallback; never use them as the
  physical second-device or real Runtime proof.
- A failed row remains open even when adjacent implementation tests pass.
