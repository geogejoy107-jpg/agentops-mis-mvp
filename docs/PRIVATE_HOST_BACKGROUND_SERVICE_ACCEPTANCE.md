# Private Host Background Service Acceptance

## Scope

This slice adds an optional macOS user-level LaunchAgent for the AgentOps MIS
Host control plane. It is deliberately separate from Worker services and from
the graphical `AgentOps MIS.app` launcher.

The service command is fixed to:

```text
agentops host start --foreground --no-workers
```

It keeps the local Host available after login/restart, but never installs or
starts Hermes/OpenClaw and never authorizes live Agent execution.

## Command Contract

```bash
agentops host service-install
agentops host service-install --confirm-install
agentops host service-check
agentops host stop
agentops host service-control --action load|unload|restart
agentops host service-control --action <action> --confirm-control
agentops host service-remove
agentops host service-remove --confirm-remove
```

- Install, launchctl control and removal are preview-only by default.
- Install writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.agentops.mis.private-host.plist`
  only after `--confirm-install`; writing does not load the service.
- The file is mode `0600` and contains only Host/install paths plus
  `PYTHONPATH`. It contains no machine key, Admin key, setup code, browser
  Session, CSRF value or Runtime credential.
- The service follows the packaged `current` link so a verified update does not
  pin a stale release directory.
- Load is blocked while an independently managed Host process is already
  running. Repeated confirmed load is an idempotent no-op.
- An existing file can be overwritten only when its complete bytes match the
  expected managed definition. An unknown or edited file fails closed.
- Removal is blocked while launchd reports the service loaded.
- The product uninstaller refuses to continue while the default service file is
  present, preventing a leftover restart loop after binary removal.
- Raw plist content and launchctl output are omitted from command responses.

## Verification

```bash
python3 -m py_compile agentops_mis_cli/host.py \
  scripts/private_host_background_service_smoke.py
python3 scripts/private_host_background_service_smoke.py
python3 scripts/private_host_lifecycle_smoke.py
python3 scripts/private_host_bundle_smoke.py
python3 scripts/release_evidence_packet_smoke.py
python3 scripts/secret_scan_smoke.py
git diff --check
```

The isolated smoke uses a temporary Host home, service path and fake launchctl
state. It proves dry-run install, confirmed write, exact host-only arguments,
private mode, credential omission, read-only check, dry-run control, confirmed
load/restart/unload, duplicate-load idempotency, loaded-removal blocking,
confirmed removal and unknown-file overwrite rejection.

## Local Service Loaded Receipt

**Superseded Preview 28.**

On 2026-07-14, preview.19 first rendered the installation plan in dry-run mode,
then wrote the default managed LaunchAgent only after the explicit
`--confirm-install` gate. During the preview.28 upgrade, the existing Host-only
service was explicitly unloaded before installation and loaded again afterward.
Current readback proves:

- the file is a safe regular plist with mode `0600`;
- its bytes exactly match the packaged managed definition;
- no credential-like material is present;
- the service command remains Host-only and starts no Worker;
- launchd reports the Host-only service loaded.

The loaded service serves the installed preview.28 Workspace on loopback and
continues to start with `--no-workers`. The independently service-managed Hermes
and OpenClaw Workers recovered fresh heartbeat state after the Host restart;
the Host service did not start, stop, or claim their processes. No Runtime task
was dispatched during the upgrade or app-open receipt. This loaded receipt is
not logout/reboot proof.

On 2026-07-15 the installed preview.28 service was exercised once more through
the consumer CLI. The unconfirmed command returned only the planned
`launchctl kickstart -k` action and reported `service_mutated:false`. The same
command with `--confirm-control` replaced the Host process, then the loopback
health check returned ready and `agentops host version` still identified exact
release commit `f627e83`. Tailscale Serve remained ready on private HTTPS with
Funnel disabled. The control receipt contained no Worker action and reported
`live_workers_started:false`; readback of the actual independent Hermes and
OpenClaw LaunchAgent units showed both still running. This proves an explicit
installed-service restart without implicit Runtime or Worker ownership. It
still does not substitute for a physical logout/reboot receipt.

## Current Preview 29

On 2026-07-15, the real Host upgraded from preview.28 to
`v1.6.0-private-host-preview.29` at exact commit
`574c735541d95b70180254235a385ff764f8c45c`. The Host LaunchAgent was
explicitly unloaded, preview.29 was installed, and the Host LaunchAgent was
loaded again. Upgrade readback reported `previous_version=.28`.

The preview.29 Host service loaded successfully and returned ready through the
installed consumer CLI. The managed plist remained Host-only, followed the
packaged `current` link and started with `--no-workers`. The independent Hermes
and OpenClaw Worker PIDs were preserved across the Host service upgrade; no
Worker was installed, started, stopped or claimed by the Host LaunchAgent. No
model task was dispatched or executed. Readback identified exact release commit
`574c735`.

Opening the installed app afterward reused the loaded Host and both Worker
processes. This is same-login service-control and process-reuse evidence only;
real physical logout/reboot persistence remains open.

preview.29 was published through the manual prerelease path; the Private Host
Preview Release workflow did not run.

## Current Preview 31

On 2026-07-15, the real Host upgraded from preview.30 to public prerelease
`v1.6.0-private-host-preview.31` at exact commit
`fed1b2410d6725a217c9727dba570db62cc46963`. The Host-only LaunchAgent was
explicitly unloaded before installation and loaded again afterward. The Host
returned ready on loopback and private Tailscale HTTPS, while Funnel remained
disabled.

The installer atomically replaced both CLI shim inodes and the commands ran
immediately after installation. The independently managed Hermes and OpenClaw
services stayed running through the install without exit 137 or `-9`; explicit
service restarts then created PIDs `38056` and `38080`, both with fresh Agent
Gateway heartbeats and no recorded exit. The Host LaunchAgent still contains
no Worker command or credential material.

This is same-login service-control, upgrade and Worker-continuity evidence. It
still does not substitute for a physical logout/reboot receipt.

## Known Limits

- This is an unsigned macOS preview, not a signed/notarized installer service.
- CI validates the launchd contract with an isolated fake launchctl. Physical
  logout/reboot persistence still requires a clean macOS account or VM receipt.
- The service keeps only the MIS Host control plane alive. Hermes/OpenClaw
  Worker services remain independent and require their own explicit live-run
  confirmation. Same-Mac Worker services can use the credential-free
  `local_config` reference described in
  `docs/PRIVATE_HOST_WORKER_SERVICE_ACCEPTANCE.md`; this does not change the
  Host-only service command.
- Browser UI controls for service installation are not included in this slice;
  the existing `.app` remains the normal low-friction way to initialize, start
  safely and open the same React Workspace.

## Next Gate

On a clean macOS account, install the exact prerelease, confirm the service,
load it only after stopping any independently managed Host, log out/reboot, and
record that the same Workspace becomes reachable without any live Worker
starting implicitly.
