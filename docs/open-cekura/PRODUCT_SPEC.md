## Product definition

OpenCekura is intended to become an open-source vertical product within
AgentOps MIS. Its formal module name is **Reliability Lab**. The current
repository is still governed by the proprietary local MVP license in `LICENSE`
and `pyproject.toml`; selecting and applying an open-source license is an Owner
decision and remains a release/distribution gate. Until then, the code must not
be described as open-source licensed or redistributed as such.

It provides reliability testing, deterministic simulation, evaluation, regression management, release gating, and inspectable evidence for AI agents. Version 0 supports chat agents, tool-using agents, HTTP agents, and a deterministic mock agent. Live voice, WebRTC, SIP, LiveKit, Pipecat, Vapi, and Retell are explicitly deferred to v0.2.

The v0 value chain is complete only when it closes this loop:

```text
Scenario
→ Simulation
→ ToolCall observation
→ Evaluation
→ Failure
→ Regression
→ Release Gate
→ Evidence
→ Reliability Lab UI
```

A chat-only demonstration, a static UI, or a numeric score without an evidence chain does not satisfy this specification.

## Clean-room and public-claims boundary

The implementation is based on the user's product requirements and the public capability category, not on private Cekura code, private APIs, reverse engineering, copied HTML, or copied brand design. OpenCekura must not be described as an official Cekura open-source edition. Simulation evidence demonstrates only the configured test conditions; it must not be presented as proof of production reliability.

The repository's `docs/PUBLIC_CLAIMS_AND_LIMITATIONS.md` remains controlling for authentication, tenancy, production readiness, security, and deployment claims.

## MIS authority mapping

OpenCekura may own vertical business tables, but it must not create a second Task, Run, Approval, or Audit ledger.

| Reliability object | MIS authority | Required stable mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campaign | Task and Agent Plan | `mis_task_id`, `mis_agent_plan_id` |
| ConversationRun | Run | `mis_run_id` |
| ObservedToolCall | ToolCall | `mis_tool_call_id` |
| EvaluationResult | Evaluation | `mis_evaluation_id` |
| EvidenceManifest | Artifact and Evidence | `mis_artifact_id`, optional plan-evidence manifest ID |
| ReleaseGateDecision | Quality Gate / Approval | `mis_approval_id` or equivalent authoritative gate reference |
| RegressionCase | Memory and future Plan input | `mis_memory_id` |
| RegressionReplayMapping | Source Memory/Evaluation/Run to replay Run | typed immutable mapping row; source `mis_memory_id` |

MIS IDs are mappings, not values inferred from string shape. The existing Human Auth, owner, session, RBAC, workspace visibility, Audit chain, and Agent Gateway remain authoritative.

## Required domain objects

The following are explicit versioned models, not unstructured catch-all JSON blobs:

- `AgentUnderTest`
- `AgentVersion`
- `ScenarioSuite`
- `Scenario`
- `Persona`
- `Campaign`
- `ConversationRun`
- `ConversationTurn`
- `ObservedToolCall`
- `EvaluationResult`
- `FailureCase`
- `FailureCluster`
- `RegressionCase`
- `RegressionReplayMapping`
- `ReleaseGateDecision`
- `EvidenceManifest`

Every object has a stable ID, `schema_version`, UTC `created_at`, the relevant parent ID, and a deterministic JSON serialization contract. Bounded nested contracts may be stored as JSON, but a single giant JSON document must not replace the object graph.

## Scenario v1

Scenario input is YAML validated with Pydantic v2 or an equivalent strict validator. `schema_version: 1` is required. Unknown fields, invalid enum values, missing required fields, and incompatible schema versions fail immediately and are surfaced to the CLI. Contract errors must never be silently ignored.

The contract includes:

- stable scenario ID and human name;
- a typed persona;
- an initial user message and typed goal;
- typed challenges, including interruption and mid-flow constraint changes;
- required and forbidden tool calls;
- confirmation-before-mutation requirements;
- expected final state;
- optional turn and timeout limits.

## Simulation

The adapter contract is asynchronous:

```python
class AgentAdapter:
    async def start(...): ...
    async def send(...): ...
    async def observe_tool_calls(...): ...
    async def close(...): ...
```

v0 provides `MockAgentAdapter` and `HTTPAgentAdapter`. A run records turns, observed tool calls, timing, final backend state, timeout/error state, and agent assertions. Deterministic mode produces the same semantic outcome for identical scenario, agent version, and configuration inputs.

## Appointment reliability demo

The first public demo is **AI Appointment Agent Reliability Test**. Its mock backend exposes:

- `lookup_booking`
- `list_available_slots`
- `update_booking`
- `cancel_booking`

The suite contains at least these ten behavior classes:

1. basic success;
2. interruption;
3. change date mid-flow;
4. ambiguous identity;
5. unavailable slot;
6. duplicate request;
7. mutation before confirmation;
8. backend timeout;
9. tool succeeded but the agent claims failure;
10. agent claims success but state was not mutated.

Two agent versions are provided. Baseline contains two or three real reliability defects. Candidate fixes them. Deterministic evaluators and the gate policy—not a campaign-ID switch—must derive `Baseline → BLOCKED` and `Candidate → PASS`.

## Product surfaces

The CLI provides:

```powershell
python -m open_cekura.cli.main doctor
python -m open_cekura.cli.main scenario validate examples/open-cekura/scenarios/basic.yaml
python -m open_cekura.cli.main campaign run --suite examples/open-cekura/scenarios --agent mock
python -m open_cekura.cli.main campaign compare --baseline <id> --candidate <id>
python -m open_cekura.cli.main regression replay --campaign <source-id> --version candidate
python -m open_cekura.cli.main gate evaluate --campaign <id>
python -m open_cekura.cli.main evidence verify --campaign <id> --workspace local-demo --db agentops_mis.db
```

Regression replay is a governed next Campaign, not a direct adapter-only
simulation. Before it creates the target, the service verifies the source
Evidence tree, reconciles it with MIS Task/Plan/Run/Evaluation/Artifact/Memory/
Approval/Audit authority, validates every persisted `RegressionCase`, and
reconstructs each referenced Scenario from typed SQLite columns. Replay-local
Scenario IDs are deterministically derived after this validation because the
source IDs remain immutably bound to their original suite.

Each source RegressionCase produces one typed mapping from source Campaign, Run,
Evaluation, evaluator, Scenario, canonical input snapshot, and candidate MIS
Memory to its replay Run and replay-local Scenario. The target graph, immutable
mapping rows, MIS mappings, and publication outbox commit in the same SQLite
transaction. Repeating the same source/workspace/version/contracts request is
idempotent; source authority drift, a conflicting stable mapping, an empty
regression set, or a changed snapshot fails closed without a partial target.

Campaign Evidence envelope v3 always includes canonical
`regression_replay.json`: `null` for an ordinary Campaign and a strict envelope
containing an ordered mapping array for a replay target. `campaign_summary.json`
stores only the mapping IDs plus the SHA-256 of that array's canonical JSON
bytes, not a second copy of the mappings. Offline verification recursively
verifies source Evidence with bounded cycle/depth/work limits. Subsequent
`campaign compare` and `gate evaluate` operations must preserve the replay
artifact and pointer rather than silently replacing them with `null`.

The existing backend registers `/api/reliability/*`; the Vite browser client uses
`/mis-api/reliability/*`, which the existing proxy rewrites to that backend
namespace. The existing Vite application hosts a `Reliability Lab` workspace
feature with Overview, Agents, Scenario Suites, Campaigns, Run Detail, Failures,
Regression Suite, and Release Gates. v0 prioritizes complete read-only evidence
inspection over a visual scenario editor.

## Completion criteria

Completion requires a Windows fresh-clone workflow, passing critical doctor checks, 10+ deterministic scenarios, replayable baseline/candidate campaigns, explanatory deterministic evaluations, tamper-detecting evidence, automatic and replayable regressions, naturally derived gate outcomes, MIS-mapped SQLite/API records, the complete UI evidence chain, Windows and Ubuntu CI for Python 3.10/3.11, a green UI build, complete contracts/runbook/handoff, an exact CI run, and an open PR to `main`. The PR must not be merged by the implementation agent.
