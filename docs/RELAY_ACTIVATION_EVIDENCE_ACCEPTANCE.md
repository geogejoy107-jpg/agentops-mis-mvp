# Relay Activation Evidence Acceptance

## Scope

This acceptance covers the private, side-effect-free compiler that binds one
exact refreshed activation plan to its immutable journal identity and compiles
bounded ownership evidence after each reserved activation or rollback step.

It does not expose a CLI writer, call systemd, append journal revisions, decide
which step runs next, publish a receipt, or implement crash recovery.

## Identity Contract

`build_activation_journal_identity` accepts the private validated prerequisite
and systemd snapshots plus the exact confirmed plan hash. It recompiles the
plan and rejects stale, invalid, already-active, mismatched release, or
mismatched version input.

The returned journal identity binds:

- the exact confirmed activation plan hash;
- release and version IDs;
- pre-activation unit-file and active states;
- a canonical hash of the pre-activation enablement-link inventory; and
- a canonical hash of the installed unit file identity.

The compiler validates the result against the immutable activation-journal
schema before returning it. Raw paths, file metadata, link targets, numeric
ownership, Invocation IDs, configuration, credentials, and source snapshots
are not part of its public return type.

## Step Evidence Contract

The compiler accepts only these fixed step IDs:

| Step | Required observed state | Bound evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `daemon_reload` | original enabled/active states and inventory, reload no longer needed | unit identity and bounded state |
| `enable` | originally disabled, now enabled, active state unchanged | unit identity and exact changed link-inventory hash |
| `start` | originally inactive, now enabled and active | unit identity and exact Invocation ID |
| `verify` | enabled and active | unit identity, link-inventory hash, and bounded systemd health |
| `rollback_stop` | originally inactive, now enabled and inactive | unit identity and bounded state |
| `rollback_disable` | originally disabled, now disabled with original active state and inventory restored | unit identity and exact restored link-inventory hash |

Every current snapshot is revalidated through the Activation Plan Core. A
changed release, version, unit identity, unsafe state, pending daemon reload,
wrong ownership transition, unknown step, or tampered journal identity returns
only `activation_evidence_invalid`.

The result contains only:

```json
{
  "step_id": "start",
  "observation_id": "start_observed",
  "observation_sha256": "<64-hex>"
}
```

The observation hash is suitable for a later journal revision; the compiler
does not return its private canonical payload.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile \
  agentops_mis_cli/relay_activation_evidence.py \
  scripts/relay_activation_evidence_smoke.py
python3 scripts/relay_activation_evidence_smoke.py
python3 scripts/relay_activation_plan_smoke.py
python3 scripts/relay_activation_journal_smoke.py
python3 scripts/relay_deploy_contract_smoke.py
git diff --check
```

The deterministic smoke verifies all six observations, exact plan binding,
unit and enablement ownership changes, Invocation ID changes, stale and invalid
input rejection, bounded errors, private-payload omission, and zero network or
systemd mutation.

Expected summary:

```json
{
  "deterministic_plan_bound_identity": true,
  "invalid_inputs_redacted": true,
  "network_used": false,
  "observation_count": 6,
  "ok": true,
  "ownership_identity_changes_detected": true,
  "private_payload_omitted": true,
  "systemd_mutation_performed": false
}
```

## Remaining Gates

The private exact-confirmed success controller now holds the lifecycle lock,
refreshes and matches the plan, opens the production journal, appends the
prepared revision before mutation, invokes one private mutation at a time,
rescans and compiles each observation, publishes one immutable receipt, and
appends terminal state. It is not exposed through the CLI.

Exact interruption resume and activation-owned rollback remain required before
the CLI can use that controller.

Real daemon reload, enable, start, stop, disable, reboot persistence, and crash
recovery require a disposable Linux systemd host with root authority. Public
Relay and physical ordinary-browser acceptance remain separate gates.
