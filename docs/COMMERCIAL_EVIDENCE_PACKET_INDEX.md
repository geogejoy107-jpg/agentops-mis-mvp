# Commercial Evidence Packet Index

## Purpose

This index is the Lane 4 starting point for the commercial migration clean-room
plan. It defines which operator evidence packets may be generated for promotion
review, where each packet must derive evidence from, and which inputs are
forbidden. It is an index only: no packet in this document claims hosted,
billing, cleanup, Postgres, or commercial deployment readiness.

## Authority Boundary

- Source branch: rebuild from current `origin/main`.
- PR #22 status: reference evidence only; do not merge or copy the branch as a
  whole.
- Authority system: AgentOps MIS first-party ledgers, release gates, CI checks,
  command manifests, and acceptance docs.
- Packet posture: read-only evidence projection until a dedicated generator and
  smoke prove the packet from current source.
- Promotion posture: exact current-head CI is required before any promotion
  packet may claim readiness.

## Forbidden Inputs

Evidence packet generators must not read, store, or commit:

- raw logs
- raw prompts
- raw model responses
- private messages or full transcripts
- credentials, tokens, `.env`, or secret-bearing config
- local SQLite DBs or DB dumps
- `node_modules`, `dist`, caches, or generated export snapshots
- stale packet snapshots copied from PR #22

## Packet Inventory

| Packet | Purpose | Source Of Truth | Current Status | Required Smoke |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Evidence Status | Summarize current local MVP gates and known commercial limits. | `docs/V1_5_MERGE_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/RELEASE_EVIDENCE_PACKET.md`, current git/CI readback. | generator smoke added | `commercial_current_evidence_status_smoke.py` |
| Release Evidence Packet | Emit exact SHA, CI state, canonical commands, and release posture. | `scripts/release_evidence_packet_smoke.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, GitHub Actions readback. | existing generator | `release_evidence_packet_smoke.py` |
| Commercial Handoff Status | Show which clean-room lanes are complete, blocked, or queued. | `docs/COMMERCIAL_MIGRATION_CLEAN_ROOM_BREAKDOWN.md`, lane acceptance docs, merged PR history. | generator smoke added | `commercial_handoff_status_smoke.py` |
| Promotion Preflight | Check whether a branch can be promoted to review without unsafe claims. | current `HEAD`, `git status`, branch control smoke, secret scan, release evidence smoke. | generator smoke added | `commercial_promotion_preflight_smoke.py` |
| Promotion Packet | Bundle exact-head evidence after CI and preflight pass. | current source, current-head CI, release evidence, acceptance docs. | generator smoke added | `commercial_promotion_packet_smoke.py` |
| Receipt Plan | Define the human review receipt expected before risky commercial changes. | approval/receipt docs, prepared-action inventory, release freeze protocol. | generator smoke added | `commercial_receipt_plan_smoke.py` |
| Receipt Recording | Record review receipts without executing billing, cleanup, hosted, or live runtime actions. | AgentOps MIS receipt/audit objects and redacted metadata only. | indexed only | `commercial_receipt_recording_smoke.py` |
| Rerun Bundle Preview | List deterministic commands needed to reproduce packet evidence on another machine. | release command manifest, CI workflow, acceptance docs. | indexed only | `commercial_rerun_bundle_preview_smoke.py` |

## Generator Rules

1. Generate packets from current source at runtime. Do not commit stale rendered
   packet output as the source of truth.
2. Include exact `git rev-parse HEAD` and upstream/dirty-state readback where a
   packet makes branch or promotion claims.
3. Require current-head green CI before any packet says a branch is ready to
   promote or release.
4. Store hashes, paths, counts, and safe summaries only. Omit raw logs,
   prompts, responses, secrets, DB contents, and full transcripts.
5. Keep commercial claims explicit and negative until the dedicated gate exists:
   no billing provider call, no destructive cleanup, no hosted readiness, no
   Postgres dependency for local MVP, and no live runtime execution.
6. Add one packet generator at a time, with a focused smoke, release-evidence
   manifest entry, CI wiring, and an acceptance note.

## Next Implementation Slice

Use `python3 scripts/commercial_current_evidence_status_smoke.py` as the first
generator. It reads only current tracked docs and command manifests, emits a
redacted JSON summary, and fails if it finds unsafe readiness claims or stale
generated packet output. The next generator should be
`commercial_handoff_status_smoke.py`.

Use `python3 scripts/commercial_handoff_status_smoke.py` as the handoff packet.
It reads the packet index, clean-room breakdown and acceptance docs, then emits
safe lane and packet status without running live systems. The next generator
should be `commercial_promotion_preflight_smoke.py`.

Use `python3 scripts/commercial_promotion_preflight_smoke.py` as the promotion
preflight packet. It checks clean working-tree state, upstream sync, exact-head
CI, branch-control, secret-scan and release-evidence command wiring without
running live systems. The next generator should be
`commercial_promotion_packet_smoke.py`.

Use `python3 scripts/commercial_promotion_packet_smoke.py` as the promotion
packet. It bundles current-source evidence references after preflight while
keeping commercial readiness claims negative until later gates exist. The next
generator should be `commercial_receipt_plan_smoke.py`.

Use `python3 scripts/commercial_receipt_plan_smoke.py` as the receipt plan
packet. It defines the human review receipt and prepared-action requirements for
risky commercial changes without recording receipts or executing actions. The
next generator should be `commercial_receipt_recording_smoke.py`.
