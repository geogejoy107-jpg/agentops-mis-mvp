# AgentOps MIS BYOC

This package runs the commercial control plane as Next.js/TypeScript on Node.js
with PostgreSQL 16. It does not start or proxy the Python API and does not use
SQLite as an authority store.

## Customer Release

Customer delivery does not require this source tree. The release workflow first
publishes the commercial image, resolves its immutable OCI digest, and builds a
checksum-manifested source-free bundle:

```bash
node deploy/byoc/build-release-bundle.mjs build \
  --output /private/path/agentops-byoc-release \
  --image registry.example.com/agentops-mis@sha256:<64-hex-digest> \
  --source-revision <40-hex-git-revision>
```

The customer receives that bundle, not the repository. It contains the release
Compose model and operational backup, restore, and retained-data lifecycle
tools, but no Dockerfile, application source, package-manager input, Git
metadata, credentials, customer data, or source-side builder. The producer signs
the release archive with a GitHub OIDC/Sigstore build-provenance attestation; the
no-checkout consumer verifies that independent signature against the exact
repository, workflow, ref, and source SHA before extraction. After provenance
verification, verify the extracted bundle's internal integrity before preparing
private configuration:

```bash
cd /private/path/agentops-byoc-release
./install.sh --verify-only
```

See `RELEASE_BUNDLE.md` for the customer-side startup boundary. The source-tree
instructions below are for maintainers building and testing the image before
publication.

The current customer release is explicitly `linux/amd64`; it is not a
multi-architecture or ARM64 release. The producer and manifest bind that
platform, customer promotion evidence verifies the published image's OS and
architecture before packaging, and the installer rejects an unsupported Docker
daemon before creating customer secrets.

Clean installation itself does not require host Node.js. Packaged backup and
retained-data lifecycle operations currently require Node.js 20 or newer and
fail before creating output or state when that runtime is unavailable.

After the source-free installer completes, the customer initializes the first
workspace Owner with the packaged command:

```bash
./owner-init.sh \
  --workspace-id ws_customer \
  --username owner \
  --display-name "Workspace Owner"
```

Its default prompt reads and confirms the password from `/dev/tty` with echo
disabled. `--password-stdin` is available for bounded automation and accepts one
line only. The password is never accepted in argv, exported through the process
environment, generated on the customer's behalf, or written to a receipt. The
profile reuses only the migrator role and its existing Compose secret; a tmpfs
`PGPASSFILE` carries database authentication after the container drops
privileges. Repeating or racing initialization for the same workspace fails
closed through the existing transaction and advisory lock in
`bootstrap-owner.ts`.

The receipt retains the safe `user.user_id` and `membership.workspace_id`, role,
and status for later administration. This command does not create an entitlement
and does not alter the independently generated `entitlement-operator-password`.
The initial entitlement still goes through the v11 challenge and the isolated
`entitlement-admin` profile documented below.

## Prepare

1. Copy `.env.example` to an untracked `.env`.
2. Create private secret files without printing their values:

   ```bash
   install -d -m 700 deploy/byoc/secrets
   umask 077
   openssl rand -hex 32 > deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-migrator-password
   openssl rand -hex 32 > deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-runtime-password
   openssl rand -hex 32 > deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-entitlement-admin-password
   openssl rand -base64 32 > deploy/byoc/secrets/entitlement-operator-password
   openssl rand -hex 32 > deploy/byoc/secrets/human-session-hmac-key
   chmod 600 deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-migrator-password \
     deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-runtime-password \
     deploy/byoc/secrets/postgres-entitlement-admin-password \
     deploy/byoc/secrets/entitlement-operator-password \
     deploy/byoc/secrets/human-session-hmac-key
   ```

3. For secret settings, keep only file paths in `.env`:

   ```dotenv
   AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD_FILE=./secrets/postgres-migrator-password
   AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_RUNTIME_PASSWORD_FILE=./secrets/postgres-runtime-password
   AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_ENTITLEMENT_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE=./secrets/postgres-entitlement-admin-password
   AGENTOPS_ENTITLEMENT_OPERATOR_PASSWORD_FILE=./secrets/entitlement-operator-password
   AGENTOPS_HUMAN_SESSION_HMAC_KEY_FILE=./secrets/human-session-hmac-key
   ```

   Never commit `.env` or the `deploy/byoc/secrets/` directory.

### Optional TypeScript Worker profiles

The commercial image contains the TypeScript Worker and `tsx` runtime, so the
customer needs no repository checkout. Workers remain disabled unless an
operator explicitly selects `worker-hermes` or `worker-openclaw` after issuing
a scoped Agent Gateway enrollment for that Worker.

Each Worker mounts only its own Agent token file. Keep the one-time token in the
file configured by `.env`; never put it in `.env`, argv, or a committed file.
The supervisor rejects direct token environment values, requires production
mode and a trusted HTTPS AgentOps URL, validates bounded receipts, and never
prints token, raw prompt, or raw response. OpenClaw uses a separate provider
sidecar. Its config secret, Linux runtime, and read-only working directory are
mounted only into that sidecar and are not shipped in this repository.

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/byoc/.env -f deploy/byoc/compose.yaml \
  --profile worker-hermes up -d worker-hermes

docker compose --env-file deploy/byoc/.env -f deploy/byoc/compose.yaml \
  --profile worker-openclaw up -d worker-openclaw
```

The Hermes Worker runs as UID/GID `1000`. The OpenClaw profile runs the Worker
as UID/GID `1000` and its provider sidecar as UID `1001`, GID `1000`; they share
only a Unix-socket volume. Both use read-only root filesystems, drop all
capabilities, keep bounded tmpfs state, and have independent health and restart
supervision. The provider has no host port and is not attached to the control-
plane network. The Agent heartbeat, task claim, run heartbeat, cost reservation,
and approval ledger remain authoritative. Real providers are never enabled by
the default Compose graph. Keep `AGENTOPS_WORKER_ALLOW_HIGH_RISK=false` unless
separately approved.

4. Keep `AGENTOPS_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1` unless TLS is terminated by a trusted
   reverse proxy on the same private deployment boundary.
5. Set `AGENTOPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact HTTPS browser origin.
6. Set `AGENTOPS_ENTITLEMENT_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` to an externally reachable,
   trusted HTTPS URL and `AGENTOPS_ENTITLEMENT_OPERATOR_USERNAME` to the
   intended Human operator. Optionally set
   `AGENTOPS_ENTITLEMENT_CONTROL_PLANE_ORIGIN` to the browser origin used for
   Origin/CSRF binding. These values are routing and identity configuration,
   not secrets.

Do not put a raw PostgreSQL password, Human Session HMAC key, or credentialed
DSN in `.env`. The PostgreSQL container and one-shot migrator receive only the
migrator password. The migrator additionally receives the runtime and
entitlement-admin passwords only long enough to create or rotate those
restricted logins. The control plane receives only the runtime password and
Human Session HMAC key; it cannot read the migrator, entitlement-admin, or
operator password, and the migrator cannot read the Human Session HMAC key.

The database identities are intentionally different:

- `agentops_migrator` owns the application schema and applies the
  checksum-pinned manifest.
- `agentops_runtime` owns no protected relation, cannot alter the schema,
  cannot write `agentops_schema_migrations`, and cannot directly
  `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` `run_cost_reservations` or
  `workspace_entitlements`.
- `agentops_entitlement_admin` can execute only the v11 entitlement challenge
  plan/apply API. It has no direct table access to Human credentials,
  entitlements, audit rows, reservations, runs, memberships, or migration
  state.
- `agentops_fn_<schema-hash>` is a passwordless `NOLOGIN`, `NOINHERIT` owner
  derived from the application and runtime API schema names. It owns all
  application `SECURITY DEFINER` functions and bounded API wrappers, but no
  application relations and neither schema's `CREATE` privilege. Provisioning
  explicitly clears any pre-existing password verifier.

Cost reservation writes cross a separately owned
`agentops_runtime_api` schema through five explicitly granted
`SECURITY DEFINER` functions with a fixed search path. The runtime retains
ordinary application table operations but cannot invoke the original owner
functions directly. Production startup and health transactions verify this
role boundary against the PostgreSQL catalog and fail closed if an owner or
over-privileged DSN is supplied.

Provisioning also removes the migrator's global default `PUBLIC EXECUTE` grant
for future functions. Existing and newly created application functions are not
runtime-executable unless the bounded API grants them explicitly. Runtime
readiness verifies the complete application-function allowlist; it contains
only the approval-binding and PreparedAction-lease validation helpers required
by ordinary trigger-backed writes. Before pending migrations execute, the
migrator receives temporary membership and schema `CREATE` for the derived
function owner, allowing upgrades to replace functions already owned by that
identity. The transaction revokes that handoff after migration, rebuilds the
wrappers, transfers application `SECURITY DEFINER` ownership, and revokes both
again before commit. No fourth password or customer-managed secret is required.
Readiness verifies the final role attributes, zero memberships, schema grants,
a database-wide ownership closed set that permits only the expected functions,
wrapper source, fixed search path, and exact executable grantees.
Re-provisioning removes stale non-owner `EXECUTE` grants from application
`SECURITY DEFINER` functions before the transaction commits.
The runtime API schema is verified as an exact eight-function closed set, so an
unregistered wrapper, owner, signature, or executable grantee fails readiness.

Entitlement administration is a high-privilege operator action, not a normal
control-plane request. The optional `entitlement-admin` Compose profile is
one-shot and mounts only the entitlement-admin database password and the Human
operator password. It never receives migrator, runtime, or Human Session HMAC
secrets. It waits for the TypeScript control plane to become healthy, requires
an externally trusted HTTPS control-plane URL (plain HTTP is accepted only for
an explicit loopback test/local URL), and probes the workspace-scoped v11
challenge route before starting the CLI. Do not use the Compose-internal
`http://control-plane` service address as a commercial authentication channel.
A missing route, redirect, transport error, or route that does not advertise
`POST` fails closed before entitlement code runs.

The CLI uses the Human operator login to request a short-lived, single-use
challenge bound to the complete entitlement request, then uses the separate
admin database identity to plan or apply it. It never receives the runtime or
migrator DSN and cannot fall back to the legacy direct-table administration
path when the challenge API is unavailable. Preview a change without
`--confirm` first:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/byoc/.env \
  -f deploy/byoc/compose.yaml \
  --profile entitlement-admin run --rm entitlement-admin \
  --workspace-id ws_customer \
  --operator-user-id usr_owner \
  --edition team_governance \
  --status active \
  --capabilities enrollment_issue,session_issue,run_start \
  --max-agents 20 \
  --max-active-enrollments 20 \
  --max-active-sessions-per-agent 5 \
  --max-concurrent-runs 10 \
  --max-monthly-runs 1000 \
  --max-monthly-cost-usd 1000.000000 \
  --effective-at 2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z \
  --expires-at 2027-08-01T00:00:00.000Z
```

After reviewing the plan receipt, repeat with `--confirm --expect-absent` for
initial creation, or `--confirm --expected-revision <sha256>` for an update.
The password in `entitlement-operator-password` must match the intended Human
operator's active login credential, and `AGENTOPS_ENTITLEMENT_OPERATOR_USERNAME`
must identify that same account. Never mount either admin secret into the
long-running control-plane service. The preflight does not read an API response
body and neither the entrypoint nor its errors print request URLs, URL
credentials, cookies, CSRF values, operator passwords, or challenge tokens.

The Node services do not depend on the host file UID being `1000`. Their
entrypoint is PID 1 and starts with only the capabilities needed to read the
Compose secret,
copies each required regular non-symlink file through a stable descriptor into
an unpredictable `0700` directory inside the dedicated
`/run/agentops-runtime-secrets` tmpfs, sets the copy to `0400` and `1000:1000`,
then drops all groups and switches to the fixed Node UID/GID before starting
`npm`. It also requires Linux to report zero capabilities in the inheritable,
permitted, effective, and ambient sets, plus `NoNewPrivs=1` after the drop. Any
unreadable, empty, oversized, replaced, or symlinked secret, an unexpected
runtime UID/GID, retained capability, or a failed privilege drop stops startup.
The container-local copies are removed on normal exit and live only in a
size-limited `noexec,nosuid` tmpfs, not in the container writable layer or
PostgreSQL authority volume. A crash or forced container removal therefore
cannot preserve the prepared copies in an image layer. No privileged init
process remains above the entrypoint; after the entrypoint drops its own
identity, it forwards termination signals to the service, removes the prepared
copies after the child exits, and then preserves the child's exit status or
terminating signal.

The control-plane healthcheck uses the same drop-and-verify function before its
loopback request, so the periodic probe does not retain root identity or
effective capabilities and does not read or print the response body.

## Start

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/byoc/.env \
  -f deploy/byoc/compose.yaml \
  up --build --detach
```

The one-shot `migrate` service applies the checksum-pinned PostgreSQL manifest
through `AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_MIGRATOR_DSN(_FILE)` or the equivalent migrator
component settings. It then provisions the restricted runtime role and grants
the bounded cost API. The application uses only
`AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_DSN(_FILE)` or the equivalent runtime component settings,
checks the same manifest and catalog fingerprint, verifies the role boundary,
and fails closed if the schema, ownership, or privileges have drifted.

Existing installations that used one PostgreSQL role do not silently continue
with that shared owner. Add all three database password files and role names to the
untracked `.env`, then run the one-shot migrator. It creates the restricted
runtime login transactionally before the control plane is allowed to start.

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/mis/health
```

Do not run `docker compose down --volumes` against a customer environment. The
named PostgreSQL volume is authority data; backup, upgrade, restore, and
rollback procedures must be completed before image promotion.

## Backup And Restore Drill

Create a permission-restricted backup bundle:

```bash
deploy/byoc/backup.sh backups/agentops-before-upgrade.bundle
```

The output is a new `0700` directory containing `database.dump`,
`SHA256SUMS`, and `COMMITTED`. The script reserves the output directory
atomically, builds the dump and checksum in a random private staging directory,
and publishes `COMMITTED` last. A bundle is valid only after that marker exists.
The script never reuses an existing path, so concurrent writers and symlinked
outputs fail closed without replacing another backup.

Restore into a new isolated database and verify it against the migration
manifest and catalog fingerprint embedded in the current image:

```bash
deploy/byoc/restore-drill.sh backups/agentops-before-upgrade.bundle
```

The drill rejects incomplete, symlinked, or checksum-mismatched bundles before
creating a database. It drops its isolated database after verification and
prints success only after the requested cleanup or retention disposition is
confirmed. Restore or verification failures always trigger cleanup even when
`AGENTOPS_RESTORE_KEEP=true`; a cleanup failure is itself a non-zero result.
Before validation, the three bundle files are copied into a random private
staging directory. After structural checks, the files are sealed `0400` and the
directory is sealed `0500`. The checksum and `pg_restore` both use that staged
read-only object, so replacing the original bundle path after validation cannot
change the restored bytes. The staging directory is removed on success, failure,
or a handled termination signal.

Because the dump deliberately omits ownership and ACLs, restore validation does
not stop at a read-only schema check. The default Compose migrator component
settings are converted beside the staged migrator password into three new
`0400` DSN files targeting the isolated database. The checksum-pinned
migration/provisioning command consumes only the derived migrator DSN while the
runtime and entitlement-admin role passwords remain available for provisioning.
This rebuilds their grants and transfers every bounded `SECURITY DEFINER`
function to the derived `NOLOGIN` function owner. The password inputs are then
removed from the child environment, and the manifest, fingerprint, runtime
boundary, and entitlement-admin boundary checks consume only their respective
derived DSN files. The migrator DSN is unset and deleted before those checks,
whose checker also rejects any inherited migrator DSN or password input. The v4
receipt is emitted only when both role boundaries explicitly verify the
restricted function owner.

Custom Compose deployments may supply
`AGENTOPS_POSTGRES_MIGRATOR_DSN_FILE` to the migrator instead of component
settings. The default BYOC entrypoint rejects credentialed DSN environment
values and rejects a migrator DSN file combined with migrator component
credentials. When the drill selects the isolated restore database, it parses
the staged migrator DSN as a PostgreSQL URL and changes only the database
pathname; query parameters such as `sslmode`, certificate settings, and
connection timeouts are preserved in all three derived DSNs. Component and DSN
file inputs therefore converge on the same file-backed migration and validation
flow. Direct runtime/admin DSNs or password values fail closed. All derived
files are removed on success, failure, or a handled signal, and no full DSN is
copied into an environment variable or printed.

Set a unique `AGENTOPS_RESTORE_DATABASE` and
`AGENTOPS_RESTORE_KEEP=true` only when an operator intends to retain a fully
verified restore for a separately reviewed promotion. The script refuses to
target the configured production database. `AGENTOPS_RESTORE_KEEP` accepts
only `true` or `false`.

## Retained-data lifecycle

The first operator-facing upgrade lifecycle is
`deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs`. It records an atomic private state
file outside the repository by default under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/agentops-mis/byoc-lifecycle`. Set
`AGENTOPS_BYOC_LIFECYCLE_STATE_DIR` to a private durable host path when the
default is not appropriate. The directory and state file are kept at `0700`
and `0600`; each update is fsynced to a new file and atomically renamed while
an exclusive operation lock is held.

Pull or otherwise load the target image first. The target must be addressed by
an immutable registry digest, never a floating tag:

```bash
deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs plan \
  --to-image registry.example/agentops-mis@sha256:<64-hex-digest>

deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs status

deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs apply \
  --plan-id byoc_lifecycle_<20-hex-id>
```

`plan` is read-only with respect to authority data. It verifies the current
running container and PostgreSQL readiness, reads the static Schema identity
from both images, binds the source and target image references and local image
IDs, binds the Schema contract, expected catalog fingerprint, migration count,
and migration-manifest hash, and verifies that the runtime connection's actual
authority database equals the PostgreSQL service's configured database. It
hashes the resolved Compose configuration and reports whether active Runs still
block apply. Both source and target images must package the v1 Schema identity
command; older images require a separately reviewed bootstrap procedure.

`apply` re-verifies all plan bindings and fails if Compose or `.env` resolution
changed. It requires zero `running` or `waiting_approval` Runs, stops the
control plane, checks active Runs and the bound database again, then creates and
fsyncs a committed backup bundle while writes are impossible. The same durable
state update binds that backup and arms recovery before invoking the target
image's one-shot forward migrator, so a stopped-system backup is never reused
after service writes resume. The state advances to `applied` only after the
target control plane is healthy and its manifest, catalog fingerprint, and
database-role boundary pass. A failure after recovery is armed leaves the
service stopped, keeps the state at `backup_ready`, and marks
`recovery_required=true`; it never reports the target as installed.

The plan also binds PostgreSQL's cluster system identifier and the authority
database OID. Apply and rollback re-check both values. Database renames preserve
the bound OID, allowing recovery to distinguish the recorded authority,
quarantine, and restored objects from unrelated databases that happen to reuse
the same names. Every destructive rename or drop runs through one helper that
holds the fixed PostgreSQL session advisory key `7157544864185932631`, verifies
cluster/OID/comment identity, terminates target connections, verifies identity
again, and then executes DDL in that same `psql` session. The helper requires an
explicit `marker_mode` of `ignore` or `exact`: authority and quarantine objects
use `ignore` because customer database comments are not lifecycle identity,
while a restore object uses `exact` and must match its operation-bound marker.

The running control-plane database identity probe uses the same restricted
runtime-secret preparation and privilege-drop boundary as production startup:
`/usr/local/lib/agentops/node-secret-entrypoint.mjs --postgres-runtime -- npm run
byoc:database-identity --silent`. Invoking the npm script directly with
`docker compose exec` is unsupported because that child process would not have
the temporary file-backed runtime credential prepared by the entrypoint.
The lifecycle schema-readiness probe uses that same runtime secret entrypoint;
an independent `docker exec` never relies on the startup process's in-memory DSN.

The restore drill starts a container-side guardian before `pg_restore`. The
guardian holds advisory key `7157544864185932631` for the complete restore and
releases it only after `pg_restore` has exited. Because the guardian and restore
run inside the PostgreSQL container, loss of the host-side Docker client cannot
make an in-progress restore appear unlocked to lifecycle recovery.

Rollback is destructive and requires the operation ID as explicit confirmation:

```bash
deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs rollback \
  --confirm-restore-from-backup byoc_lifecycle_<20-hex-id>

deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs cleanup \
  --confirm-operation-id byoc_lifecycle_<20-hex-id>

deploy/byoc/retained-data-lifecycle.mjs recover-lock \
  --confirm-operation-id byoc_lifecycle_<20-hex-id>
```

For rollback, backup restore is authoritative. The command validates the exact
committed bundle, runs the existing isolated restore/provisioning drill with the
recorded source image, and promotes that verified database through a
production/quarantine database-name swap. The state checkpoints
`restore_intent`, `restore_verified`, `production_rename_started`,
`production_quarantined`, `restore_promotion_started`, `restore_promoted`, and
`rollback_verified`. A restore database is never created before its
deterministic name is durable. If an interruption leaves that database behind
before verification is recorded, the next confirmed rollback deletes it only
after its PostgreSQL database comment matches the operation ID and committed
backup hash, then rebuilds it from the bound backup instead of adopting an
unverified orphan. An unmarked or differently marked same-name database fails
closed and is not deleted. The restored database OID is checkpointed before any
production rename; later promotion and cleanup require the recorded OIDs and
cluster identity to match.
After a host interruption, rerunning the same confirmed rollback reads
`pg_database` and resumes from the persisted checkpoint instead of guessing
from process memory. It starts the recorded source image and verifies health,
Schema readiness, role boundaries, and the authority database before recording
`rolled_back`. The durable state first records the quarantine database with
`quarantine_cleanup_pending=true`; only then does the command try to delete it
and persist cleanup confirmation. A crash or cleanup failure therefore leaves a
recoverable quarantine named in `status` instead of creating a false rollback
receipt. Rerun the explicit `cleanup --confirm-operation-id` command to verify
the restored installation, delete the recorded quarantine if it remains, and
persist `cleanup_complete`. It does not perform an in-place down migration and
does not claim that a forward-migrated database is compatible with the old
image. A failure after a rename checkpoint keeps the service stopped and marks
recovery required; rerunning the same explicit rollback continues the verified
database swap.

A new `plan` is refused while
rollback cleanup is not strictly complete. Only
`quarantine_cleanup_pending=false` together with a durable
`cleanup_complete` database-swap checkpoint and quarantine removal timestamp
can be archived; missing or older state fields fail closed. The recorded
quarantine must be verified and removed with the confirmed `cleanup` command
before operation history can advance.

Do not remove the lifecycle state directory or its backup bundle while an
operation is active. An operation lock left by process or host failure is never
broken automatically. After proving no lifecycle process is running and
preserving the state and backup, a Human operator may run the confirmed
`recover-lock` command. Recovery validates the exact operation ID, private lock
metadata, host identity, boot identity, PID, and process-start identity; it
refuses a live owner, cross-host owner, changed/tampered owner, unsafe path, or
unverifiable identity. Each external Docker, restore, or SQL command runs in a
tracked process group with a private child lease under the lock. Recovery also
refuses while any recorded child process group remains alive. Even after those
host-side PID/PGID checks pass, recovery must prove through PostgreSQL that the
shared advisory lease `7157544864185932631` is available; an active database
lease refuses recovery. A successful recovery removes only the verified stale
lock and does not change lifecycle state.

This protocol serializes AgentOps lifecycle, migration, restore, rename, and
drop operations that honor the shared advisory key. Direct DDL by an external
DBA or automation that does not acquire this lock is an explicit operational
trust boundary: operators must exclude such out-of-band DDL for the entire
lifecycle window. The lifecycle cannot make an uncooperative PostgreSQL
superuser participate in its lock protocol. Never run
`docker compose down --volumes` as part of this workflow.

The lifecycle contracts use an offline injected Docker driver to exercise the
state machine, failure windows, and packaging. They are offline behavior and
packaging evidence only. The reusable
`.github/workflows/byoc-compose-acceptance.yml` workflow separately packages a
real Docker/Compose clean install, committed backup, isolated restore, and
same-Schema image lifecycle. It binds immutable image digests, retains the
PostgreSQL volume and cluster identity, preserves pre-backup authority, writes
post-apply data, and verifies backup-authoritative rollback.

The independent
`.github/workflows/byoc-cross-schema-v9-v11-acceptance.yml` workflow builds its
audited fixed historical v9 ancestor as a Node 22 image and builds the exact
current workflow HEAD as the v11 target image. On the same PostgreSQL volume
and cluster it applies exactly three manifest migrations, writes a v11-only
probe, restores the committed pre-upgrade backup as rollback authority, and
restarts the historical image. It does not run a down migration or claim that
the forward-migrated database can be opened by the historical image.

These real workflows are packaged release gates. Successful execution evidence
belongs to the exact source commit and GitHub workflow run being promoted; this
README intentionally records no run ID or source SHA. Final BYOC promotion
still requires green exact-head workflow results and merge promotion for that
same candidate.

The source-free customer artifact is built by
`deploy/byoc/build-release-bundle.mjs` and documented in
`deploy/byoc/RELEASE_BUNDLE.md`. The dedicated
`.github/workflows/byoc-customer-release-acceptance.yml` gate publishes an exact
source and target OCI image, transfers only the bounded tar archive to a
separate no-checkout runner, and executes the packaged installer, backup,
isolated restore, retained-data apply, and backup-authoritative rollback there.
The runner verifies authority retention, post-apply probe removal, source image
restoration, stable PostgreSQL volume and cluster identity, and final
TypeScript/PostgreSQL readiness. A local source-tree Compose run or a bundle
directory created and consumed in one checkout is not evidence for the
clean-customer requirement.
